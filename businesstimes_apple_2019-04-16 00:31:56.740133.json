Some different thinking did seem in order.Since becoming the first trillion-dollar corporation last summer, Apple has battled a souring assessment on Wall Street. The iPhone is the most profitable product in the history of business, but more than a decade after its debut, pretty much everyone on the planet who can afford one already has one, and many customers see little reason to upgrade.So now, instead of selling better stuff to more people, Apple's new plan is to sell more stuff to the same people. \"Today is going to be a very different kind of event,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, taking the stage.

Aramco will be buying the stake from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, whose chairman is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The crown prince, who is the kingdom's main economic policymaker, wants to ease the economy's dependence on oil and gas revenue through investments in technology companies like Uber. A planned offering of part of Aramco - which would have been the largest initial public offering on record - was expected to raise money for that purpose.

REGN NO. 198402668E"], "23 Mar 2019": ["[NEW YORK] Apple and Netflix, for better and for worse, have changed how we spend our leisure hours. In the process, the two companies have upended old media habits and created new ones.Apple's iPhones have already ported over big portions of people's brains, and Netflix exploded TV time slots, creating the binge and the endless content screen. Where else can you find a soothing Japanese reality show like \"Terrace House\" and a Brechtian, mind-bending drama like \"Russian Doll\" in one place?While setting the standard in their chosen areas, Apple and Netflix have gotten along in the past, for the most part. But that period of peace between the two tech giants is about to change.On Monday, Apple will unveil its most ambitious media project yet \u2014 a news and entertainment bundle that is likely to offer access to magazines, newspapers, music and, perhaps most intriguingly, original shows and films. And when a tech giant like Apple jumps into entertainment, it's going to create waves.Famous for its teasing product demonstrations, Apple will play host to Hollywood at its Cupertino, California, campus so it can show off what Reese Witherspoon, JJ Abrams, M Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg (he's of the view that Netflix films should not get Oscars) have done with the more than US$1 billion the company has laid out for its new ambitions.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Netflix is about to raise prices, but one analyst says users are staying put  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe amount it has spent on new material is nowhere near the US$10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year, but Apple has something Netflix does not: more than 1 billion devices all over the world, which amounts to an infrastructure. That beats out the 139 million people worldwide who have subscribed to Netflix. If Apple is suddenly able to fill the screens of those devices with its own content, as well as programming from other companies it has struck deals with, it will turn itself into a beast sure to put a scare into Netflix.\nThe cordial relations between Apple and Netflix showed signs of fraying last November, when Netflix, led by Reed Hastings, stopped allowing people to sign up for its service through Apple's iTunes store.\nApple had been charging Netflix 15 per cent on every sale, a blanket condition of being in the App Store. Now, new subscribers can still download the Netflix app on an Apple device, but they will be sent to an external website to submit payment details. (In the wonky world of Internet transactions, where you make the purchase determines how, or if, Apple gets a cut.)\nIn a second sign of frayed relations between the two companies, Netflix has decided to opt out of the Apple bundle, which will upsell subscriptions to HBO and CBS in addition to its original programming. Netflix's absence from the new platform says a lot about the state of play in the highly competitive streaming industry: a fight is brewing over how content is distributed.\nMr Hastings explained it at a Netflix earlier this week: \"Apple's a great company. We want to have people watch our service \u2014 or our content on our service. And so we've chosen not to integrate into their service, because we prefer to have our customers watch our content in our service.\"\nThe key word here is \"service\".\u00a0\nPut it another way: Netflix is a service, or a pipe, that would sit on another service, or pipe, if it agreed to be included in the Apple bundle. And if it had joined forces with Apple, Netflix also would have received little to no data about who is subscribing or watching its stuff. Further muddying the company's identity, from the Netflix point of view, would be the fact that Apple users who spooled up \"Stranger Things\" or \"Orange Is the New Black\" may not be aware that they're watching a Netflix show. Retaining the brand is as important as owning the data.\nApple and Netflix (and others) are now in competition to become the main pipe for digital video \u2014 what television is fast becoming \u2014 and fixating on other contests, like who wins the most Emmys, is secondary to owning the pipe. The companies are battling for credit card numbers, email addresses and direct access to consumers.\nThe focus on Apple's programming makes for a tantalising narrative, given how long Silicon Valley in general and Apple in particular have remained agnostic about owning content. But original Apple fare, like the program set at a morning show starring Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, is just the appetiser. The main draw is the bundle, the one-stop service for all kinds of media. Apple's shows are likely to be free for a period to entice users into other subscriptions, such as CBS and HBO and Starz, with Apple functioning as the reseller.\nBut Netflix is also in the resale business. Although the company promotes its many \"originals\", it doesn't actually own a lot of the shows associated with the service. \"House of Cards\" and \"The Crown\", to cite two examples, are licensed.\nNetflix's programming strategy is something of a mystery, because there isn't a clear through-line on the shows it buys or makes, resulting in a hard-to-define hodgepodge. But that's by design. Netflix has long maintained that its brand isn't about any particular aesthetic, like HBO's. It's a service that aims to serve up shows for all kinds of viewers, from people who like the teenage thriller \"You\" to those who are tempted to click on the tile for the dystopian Polish sci-fi show \"1983\".\u00a0\nThe same might be said for Hulu, Amazon or Comcast, all of which fund original content while also marketing other content from channels \u2014 like HBO or CBS \u2014 within their platforms.\nNot coincidentally, Comcast announced its own streaming bundle just days ahead of the Apple showcase. Customers who only have Comcast's broadband service can spend an extra US$5 a month to get free streaming movies and TV shows from ad-supported services like Pluto and YouTube. They can also go through Comcast to purchase an HBO or a Netflix subscription. It's meant to be a one-stop shop for your streaming needs, not so different from what Apple is proposing.\nA nuance worth noting: Netflix is willing to work with Comcast \u2014 a competing distributor \u2014 and not with Apple because Netflix sees Apple as the bigger threat. Netflix executives are worried the tech giant will crack the streaming code faster than Comcast, according to two people familiar with the company who were not authorised to talk publicly. Another way of putting it: Silicon Valley companies are wary of what their next door neighbors are capable of.\nNetflix has 60 million customers in the United States, making it one of the largest distributors in the country. Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, has 25 million broadband customers. Hulu has 25 million. Amazon Prime has 97 million, but not all are watching its videos.\nTheir reach is minuscule compared with Apple, which has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. That scale explains how Apple Music, a streaming service the company started offering in 2015, garnered more than 50 million paying users so quickly.\nIt also explains why HBO (owned by AT&T), Showtime, CBS and Starz could show up on Apple's service Monday. The sheer volume of mobile devices in circulation is hard to ignore. Even before it starts offering original programming, Apple is arguably the biggest entertainment distributor on the planet.\nStill, HBO's inclusion in the Apple bundle raises questions. Its owner, AT&T, is already a large distributor, with roughly 160 million wireless customers. The company also plans to start its own streaming service \u2014 which will include HBO programs and the properties it gained through its acquisition of Warner Bros., like \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Friends\" \u2014 by the end of the year.\nFrom HBO's perspective, allowing itself to become part of Apple's streaming effort is not that different from selling its wares via Comcast or DirecTV. It's just another sales outlet. Even HBO's own streaming service, HBO Now, had a slow start until Amazon Prime started marketing it. With the push from Amazon, the number of HBO Now subscribers nearly doubled, to 5 million. (HBO has more than 7 million online customers, with those who subscribed through Amazon counting for a smaller proportion.)\nBut that kind of indifference could cut against AT&T's own plans to sell content directly to people. The wireless giant will have to weigh the value of the distribution muscle of Apple or Amazon or Hulu against its own needs. Why did AT&T buy Time Warner (which also included CNN, TNT and Warner Bros) if not to jump-start its own streaming bundle?\nWithout explicitly trying, Apple has built itself into a media colossus.\nSo what does mean for everyone else?\nMr Hastings said it best on an October earnings call when he talked about the flurry of new entrants into his area of expertise: \"The game is on.\"\nNYTIMES\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe amount it has spent on new material is nowhere near the US$10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year, but Apple has something Netflix does not: more than 1 billion devices all over the world, which amounts to an infrastructure.

Netflix's absence from the new platform says a lot about the state of play in the highly competitive streaming industry: a fight is brewing over how content is distributed.\nMr Hastings explained it at a Netflix earlier this week: \"Apple's a great company. We want to have people watch our service \u2014 or our content on our service. And so we've chosen not to integrate into their service, because we prefer to have our customers watch our content in our service.\"\nThe key word here is \"service\".\u00a0\nPut it another way: Netflix is a service, or a pipe, that would sit on another service, or pipe, if it agreed to be included in the Apple bundle. And if it had joined forces with Apple, Netflix also would have received little to no data about who is subscribing or watching its stuff. Further muddying the company's identity, from the Netflix point of view, would be the fact that Apple users who spooled up \"Stranger Things\" or \"Orange Is the New Black\" may not be aware that they're watching a Netflix show. Retaining the brand is as important as owning the data.\nApple and Netflix (and others) are now in competition to become the main pipe for digital video \u2014 what television is fast becoming \u2014 and fixating on other contests, like who wins the most Emmys, is secondary to owning the pipe. The companies are battling for credit card numbers, email addresses and direct access to consumers.\nThe focus on Apple's programming makes for a tantalising narrative, given how long Silicon Valley in general and Apple in particular have remained agnostic about owning content. But original Apple fare, like the program set at a morning show starring Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, is just the appetiser. The main draw is the bundle, the one-stop service for all kinds of media. Apple's shows are likely to be free for a period to entice users into other subscriptions, such as CBS and HBO and Starz, with Apple functioning as the reseller.\nBut Netflix is also in the resale business. Although the company promotes its many \"originals\", it doesn't actually own a lot of the shows associated with the service. \"House of Cards\" and \"The Crown\", to cite two examples, are licensed.\nNetflix's programming strategy is something of a mystery, because there isn't a clear through-line on the shows it buys or makes, resulting in a hard-to-define hodgepodge. But that's by design. Netflix has long maintained that its brand isn't about any particular aesthetic, like HBO's. It's a service that aims to serve up shows for all kinds of viewers, from people who like the teenage thriller \"You\" to those who are tempted to click on the tile for the dystopian Polish sci-fi show \"1983\".\u00a0\nThe same might be said for Hulu, Amazon or Comcast, all of which fund original content while also marketing other content from channels \u2014 like HBO or CBS \u2014 within their platforms.\nNot coincidentally, Comcast announced its own streaming bundle just days ahead of the Apple showcase. Customers who only have Comcast's broadband service can spend an extra US$5 a month to get free streaming movies and TV shows from ad-supported services like Pluto and YouTube. They can also go through Comcast to purchase an HBO or a Netflix subscription. It's meant to be a one-stop shop for your streaming needs, not so different from what Apple is proposing.\nA nuance worth noting: Netflix is willing to work with Comcast \u2014 a competing distributor \u2014 and not with Apple because Netflix sees Apple as the bigger threat. Netflix executives are worried the tech giant will crack the streaming code faster than Comcast, according to two people familiar with the company who were not authorised to talk publicly. Another way of putting it: Silicon Valley companies are wary of what their next door neighbors are capable of.\nNetflix has 60 million customers in the United States, making it one of the largest distributors in the country. Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, has 25 million broadband customers. Hulu has 25 million. Amazon Prime has 97 million, but not all are watching its videos.\nTheir reach is minuscule compared with Apple, which has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. That scale explains how Apple Music, a streaming service the company started offering in 2015, garnered more than 50 million paying users so quickly.\nIt also explains why HBO (owned by AT&T), Showtime, CBS and Starz could show up on Apple's service Monday. The sheer volume of mobile devices in circulation is hard to ignore. Even before it starts offering original programming, Apple is arguably the biggest entertainment distributor on the planet.\nStill, HBO's inclusion in the Apple bundle raises questions. Its owner, AT&T, is already a large distributor, with roughly 160 million wireless customers. The company also plans to start its own streaming service \u2014 which will include HBO programs and the properties it gained through its acquisition of Warner Bros., like \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Friends\" \u2014 by the end of the year.\nFrom HBO's perspective, allowing itself to become part of Apple's streaming effort is not that different from selling its wares via Comcast or DirecTV. It's just another sales outlet. Even HBO's own streaming service, HBO Now, had a slow start until Amazon Prime started marketing it. With the push from Amazon, the number of HBO Now subscribers nearly doubled, to 5 million. (HBO has more than 7 million online customers, with those who subscribed through Amazon counting for a smaller proportion.)\nBut that kind of indifference could cut against AT&T's own plans to sell content directly to people. The wireless giant will have to weigh the value of the distribution muscle of Apple or Amazon or Hulu against its own needs. Why did AT&T buy Time Warner (which also included CNN, TNT and Warner Bros) if not to jump-start its own streaming bundle?\nWithout explicitly trying, Apple has built itself into a media colossus.\nSo what does mean for everyone else?\nMr Hastings said it best on an October earnings call when he talked about the flurry of new entrants into his area of expertise: \"The game is on.\"\nNYTIMES\nThe amount it has spent on new material is nowhere near the US$10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year, but Apple has something Netflix does not: more than 1 billion devices all over the world, which amounts to an infrastructure. That beats out the 139 million people worldwide who have subscribed to Netflix. If Apple is suddenly able to fill the screens of those devices with its own content, as well as programming from other companies it has struck deals with, it will turn itself into a beast sure to put a scare into Netflix.The cordial relations between Apple and Netflix showed signs of fraying last November, when Netflix, led by Reed Hastings, stopped allowing people to sign up for its service through Apple's iTunes store.Apple had been charging Netflix 15 per cent on every sale, a blanket condition of being in the App Store.

During an eight-day trial, Qualcomm asked the jury to award it unpaid patent royalties of up to US$1.41 per iPhone that violated the patents.The US$31 million penalty is small change for Apple, the second most valuable US company after Microsoft Corp, with a market value of US$866 billion and annual revenue totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. But the setting of a per-phone royalty rate for Qualcomm's technology gives the chip supplier a fresh line of attack in its two-year old legal battle with Apple.The biggest case, filed by Apple in early 2017, begins in April. Apple has sought to dismantle what it calls Qualcomm's illegal business model of both licensing patents and selling chips to phone makers. Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without paying.\"The technologies invented by Qualcomm and others are what made it possible for Apple to enter the market and become so successful so quickly,\" Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel, said in a statement. \"We are gratified that courts all over the world are rejecting Apple's strategy of refusing to pay for the use of our IP.\"\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Apple adds more suppliers to clean energy programme  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nIn a statement, Apple said it was disappointed with the outcome.\n\"Qualcomm's ongoing campaign of patent infringement claims is nothing more than an attempt to distract from the larger issues they face with investigations into their business practices in US federal court, and around the world,\" Apple said. It declined to comment on whether it would appeal.\nIn other cases against Apple, Qualcomm has won sales bans on iPhones in Germany and China, though the Chinese ban has not been enforced and Apple has taken moves it believes allow it to resume sales in Germany.\nQualcomm also suffered a setback with US trade regulators who found that some iPhones infringed one of the San Diego-based company's patents but declined to bar their importation into the United States, citing the damage such a move would inflict on rival Intel Corp.\nThe verdict on Friday could come into play in the trial in April because it puts a per-phone dollar figure on some of Qualcomm's intellectual property. Qualcomm's patent licensing model relies on charging phone makers a cut of the selling price of the phone, a practice Apple has alleged is unfair and illegal.\nDuring an earlier trial between Qualcomm and the US Federal Trade Commission, Apple executives outlined their company's extensive negotiations to reduce those license fees to US$7.50 per phone for Qualcomm's patents.\nThe San Diego jury valued just three of Qualcomm's patents in the company's portfolio at US$1.41, a figure that the chip supplier believes bolsters its contention that its licensing practices are fair.\n\"The three patents found to be infringed in this case represent just a small fraction of Qualcomm's valuable portfolio of tens of thousands of patents,\" Mr Rosenberg said in a statement.\nGaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York not involved in the case, said the verdict was clearly a win for Qualcomm. But it does not say much about the value of Qualcomm's entire patent portfolio and was unlikely to spark settlements discussions, he said.\n\"Apple is very skilled at handling appeals and taking a longer-term view.

They are big, they are American and they have tended to pay relatively little tax, thanks to legal loopholes and a business model that exists largely in the virtual world.Frustrated governments have tried to use the courts and the hammer of EU regulators to squeeze more money out of the tech giants, but it has not always worked. So, rather than wait for international rules to catch up, France and a few others are embracing the tech sector equivalent of a financial transactions tax\u00a0(a generic name for levies\u00a0on transactions such as sales and purchases). It is a messy idea, but politically it makes the right noises.Nothing about France's so-called \"GAFA tax\" will please those who favour simple and lucrative approaches to raising revenue for governments. Inspired by an EU proposal that failed to get unanimous backing from the bloc's 28-member states, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire's proposal aims to hit companies making more than 750 million euros (S$1.2 billion)\u00a0in global online revenues with what amounts to a 3 per cent tax on their gross digital sales in France.It is hard to see how this will help much, if you judge things purely on their economic usefulness. It will hit firms equally regardless of their profitability, its cost may end up being passed on to consumers, and there is a basic difficulty in tracking and policing\u00a0digital revenues in an individual country.The French idea seems to be that tech companies will submit their own figures, with the threat of penalties if they get the numbers wrong. Tax authorities will probably have to find new ways of gathering information to put a value on activity like digital commissions, ad sales and data collection. Even with a planned retroactive application date of Jan 1, 2019, which is itself a controversial move, France estimates that the tax will raise a measly 500 million euros - broadly the same amount brought in by the country's financial transactions tax in 2017. It is a digital drop in the ocean of France's approximately 80 billion euro deficit.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Google's Sensorvault helps police track where you've been  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe tax has two big things going for it, though.

The alleged patent violation stemmed not from Intel chips but yet another Apple supplier - Qorvo Inc - whose chip was only present in older phones with Intel modems.The court sided with Qualcomm and banned sales of some iPhone models that used Intel modem chips, leading Apple to pull the devices from its 15 retail stories in Germany and its online store in the country.The ban was a victory in Qualcomm's legal conflict with Apple.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Europe's risk of paralysis in slowdown puts Germany on the spot  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe iPhone maker has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices to protect a monopoly on so-called modem chips, which connect mobile phones to wireless data networks.

A slowing economy, lengthening replacement times and the iPhone's hefty price tag contributed to the US giant's decline in China, IDC said. Xiaomi Corp fared even worse in the final months of last year, when unit shipments plunged almost 35 per cent, the consultancy estimates.Smartphone labels from Apple to Samsung Electronics are contending with a plateauing global market after years of breakneck growth, as a lack of industry innovation discourages consumers from replacing devices as often as they used to. Apple also has to cope with the rise of Chinese rivals such as Huawei, which is eroding its share of a market once pivotal to driving its growth. China's top electronics retailers slashed prices on the latest iPhones by as much as 20 per cent in past months - an unusual move that illustrated waning enthusiasm for Apple's gadgets.Huawei shored up its lead after unit shipments soared 23.3 per cent, leading all major brands, according to IDC. That's despite grappling with an unusually turbulent few months during which its finance chief was arrested on allegations of bank fraud, and the US marshalled its allies to try and block the company from selling next-generation networking equipment.Apple was ranked fourth by shipments in the country during the period, following Oppo and Vivo, IDC said. Fifth-ranked Xiaomi, a Chinese name that experienced rapid growth just before its 2018 initial public offering, incurred a 34.9 per cent plunge in shipments thanks to inventory corrections and an internal restructuring, IDC said.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Indonesia polls thrust China's Belt and Road push into the spotlight  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"The domestic smartphone market environment in 2019 doesn't look very optimistic,\" IDC senior analyst Wang Xi said in the report.

New York officials have said they will investigate the company's failure to warn consumers about the bug and its slow response.The House Energy and Commerce Committee oversees most tech policy issues and, under prior Republican leadership, brought Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress in April 2018.

Nor were campus maps that help people find their co-workers. They were unable to check Facebook's latest shuttle bus schedule. And they could not see what the company's cafeterias were serving for lunch.That's because those features run on Facebook's internal, custom-built iPhone apps - and Apple had shut them all down, according to nine current and former employees of the companies, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.The situation stemmed from a dispute after Facebook violated Apple's rules by publicly distributing a research app that allowed it to snoop on users' online activity. When Apple discovered the transgression this week, it revoked Facebook's special access to apps and updates that run on its iPhone software.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThat immediately cut off Facebook's 35,000 workers from its internal iPhone apps.

Yet the episode was a stark reminder of where the power really lies in the technology world. While Facebook is the world's biggest social network, Apple controls the distribution of apps - including Facebook's - on its phones. That power is a long-standing concern for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, making his company beholden to the rules of others.\nThe spat underscored the tensions between two of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, which have competed for years over talent and new technologies. Recently, each has taken potshots at the other over data privacy, with Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, trading slights with Mr Zuckerberg in interviews. Facebook also worked this past year with a public-relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, to urge reporters to scrutinise Apple and other tech companies. And Apple has made changes to some of its tech features that limit the ability of Facebook and others to track users.\nApple did not immediately have a comment Thursday after reinstating Facebook's access to its internal apps. In a statement, Facebook said it was \"getting our internal apps up and running\" and added, \"To be clear, this didn't have an impact on our consumer-facing services.\"\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said of the dispute with Apple: \"Obviously we want to be in full compliance with all of our partners.\" She added that the Facebook research app at issue hadn't been a secret and had been operated only with its users' consent.\nShow of power\nApple also briefly demonstrated its power on Thursday with another Silicon Valley giant, Google. Like Facebook, Google had violated Apple's rules by publicly distributing an app, Screenwise Meter, through a special Apple developer program. The Internet search company said some of its internal apps that run on iPhone software were temporarily disrupted.\nTwo Google employees, who declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak publicly on the matter, said iPhone apps for internal services like hailing a bus or viewing cafeteria information were not working. In addition, apps testing unreleased updates of Google products such as Gmail and Google Maps were unavailable, these people said. The disruptions were earlier reported by technology website The Verge.\nA Google spokesman, Suzanne Blackburn, said in a statement that the company expected the issue to be resolved \"soon.\" A spokesman for Apple, Tom Neumayr, said it was working with Google to reinstate access \"very quickly.\"\nHe declined to comment on whether Apple had revoked Google's access or if it was a technical glitch.\nApple's dispute with Facebook this week was rooted in the social network's practice of scooping up information on its users' practices, a way for it to gain insight into their digital habits so it can improve products to keep consumers regularly coming back to its site.\nIn 2013, Facebook acquired Onavo, an Israeli company that collected information on how customers used every app on their phones. Onavo's findings helped Facebook executives predict which apps were rising and trending across App Stores.\nThat gave Mr Zuckerberg, who colleagues have said was highly dependent on the data, the foresight to try to buy Snapchat long before it went public. Although that effort failed, Facebook has built products, such as live video streams and group video chat, based on information gleaned from Onavo's app.\nLast year, Apple updated some of its privacy policies and forced Facebook to remove Onavo's app from its App Store. But Onavo had other ways of collecting consumer data that bypassed some of Apple's restrictions.\nIn 2016, the Onavo team had created a research app that vacuumed up all of a user's phone and web activity; Facebook paid people ages 13 to 35 to install it. Then Facebook distributed the app under an Apple program with a special approval process if apps are used only for internal testing.\nNothing secret about it\nOn Tuesday, the technology news site TechCrunch published a report detailing Facebook's research app and its public use, which violated the rules of Apple's program. Facebook immediately pushed back on privacy concerns and said it was not tricking users with the research app.\n\"There was nothing 'secret' about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App,\" Arielle Argyres, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \"It wasn't 'spying' as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear onboarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate.\"\nShe added that fewer than 5 per cent of users in the research program were teenagers and that all had obtained signed parental consent forms.\nBut Facebook had no comeback for sidestepping Apple's rules. On Wednesday morning, Apple revoked Facebook's \"enterprise developer certificate\" and paralysed the social giant from deploying its internal iPhone apps.\nAfter Apple's revocation, some Facebook employees said they would have to wait weeks to get app updates or changes approved through Apple's App Store. Several employees in Facebook's hardware division said they were considering quitting because they could not get any work done.\nAfter Apple relented, Facebook employees began seeing the next day's lunch menu again, as well as their calendars and their shuttle bus schedules.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "BeijingTO most Americans, the names are unfamiliar, maybe a little hard to pronounce: Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo. They are China's biggest smartphone brands. Around the world - although not in the US - they are making the handset business brutally competitive.Last week, after Apple warned of disappointing iPhone sales in China, industry observers said that devices from the Chinese brands were a major culprit. As the phone market in China reaches saturation and sales shrink overall, the country's hardware makers are pushing hard, and increasingly winning fans, in places such as France, Germany, India and South-east Asia, where consumers find that the phones can do just about everything an iPhone can do at a fraction of the cost.Apple sits comfortably atop the market in many countries, including China, for the highest-end handsets. But companies such as Huawei have started to do elsewhere what they have done in China, competing with the iPhone on experience and value and luring customers with price comparisons that make them rethink buying Apple's signature product.The cost difference is notable: in China, an iPhone XR starts at around US$950, while Huawei's top-end handsets start at about US$600, and Xiaomi's comparable models start at even less. The iPhone XS starts at around US$1,250.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Apple adds more suppliers to clean energy programme  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nCompanies such as Huawei and Oppo have made improvements in features and overall quality that are enticing many wealthy Chinese people, said Mo Jia, an analyst in Shanghai for the technology research firm Canalys.\nChinese brands' aggressive marketing and sales campaigns in Europe indicate that the companies believe consumers there who have traditionally used iPhones will do the same thing.\nIn its pursuit of the European market, Huawei, which has its headquarters in Shenzhen and is now the world's No 2 seller of smartphones, has gone far beyond the phone store.\nHuawei has sponsored summer concerts in Greece, teamed up with Lithuania's basketball federation and backed a \"China Festival\" in Cologne, Germany.\nVivo sponsored last year's World Cup in Russia.

NYTIMESSPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD. REGN NO. 198402668E", "WHEN Apple lost more than US$75 billion in market value this past week after a surprise announcement that it is expecting lower iPhone sales than originally projected, the company put most of the blame for its troubles on China, where a slowing economy and the trade war with the United States have hurt sales.But a bigger issue for Apple might exist much closer to home, in a small, leafy town in Ohio.That's where my mom lives. She's a relatively tech-savvy retiree and a longtime Apple fan who has used many of the company's products over the years. I learned to type on an Apple IIGS at her office, and she was an early adopter of the original turquoise iMac. These days, she uses her iPhone to check Facebook and Instagram, talk with her friends and relatives, and play solitaire and \"Words With Friends\". Her phone isn't the latest model - it's a three-year-old iPhone 6S - and it's missing some of the latest features. She can't take portrait mode photos using a dual-lens camera, a feature introduced in the iPhone 7 Plus, and she can't unlock her phone using Face ID, which was introduced in the iPhone X in 2017. Her phone's battery life could be better, and the device sometimes runs out of storage space.But she's happy with it, and doesn't feel the need to upgrade. She also has a first-generation Apple Watch and a several-versions-ago MacBook Air, neither of which she's planning to replace anytime soon.\"The phone I have does just about everything I need,\" she said when I called her to ask why she hadn't upgraded to one of the newer models. \"Why pay US$800 for a new one just to be up to date? My needs aren't that complicated.\"\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nMost of the journalists who write about tech for a living (including me) are early adopters - power users who like having the latest gadgets, and who are willing to fork over money for a slightly better experience. For some of these people, Apple's announcement has come as a shock that portends potential disaster for the company. But for my mom, and the many people who are probably in her situation, the company's slowing iPhone sales aren't at all a disaster. In fact, they make total sense, and they don't have much to do with China.\nIn a letter to investors explaining the lower forecast, Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, nodded to smaller-than-expected demand for iPhone upgrades, saying that consumers were \"adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies\" and \"taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements\". The company declined to comment for this column.\nApple is also facing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei, which have flooded international markets with lower-cost Androids that are, in many cases, just as functional as iPhones. And, yes, there are issues related to President Donald Trump's trade war with China, and an overall economic slowdown in the country.\nBut the most consequential hit to Apple's bottom line may be from people who are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2015, iPhones were being replaced after roughly two years, on average, according to BayStreet Research, a firm that tracks smartphone sales. That period has jumped to roughly three years, and is expected to grow even more.\n\"We're going to move to longer replacement cycles, principally because the cost is higher,\" said Chris Caso, a tech analyst with Raymond James.\nMany of Apple's issues are common to smartphone makers. The components inside newer phones, such as added memory and improved screen technology, are more expensive than older components. Refurbished and used phones are also more easily available, and carriers like Verizon and AT&T aren't subsidising new phone purchases as heavily as they once did, meaning that the upfront cost to the customer is higher.\n\"It used to be that for US$650, you got all new features, a better screen, everything,\" Mr Caso said. \"Now, to put more features in the phone, it costs money.\"\nThere are Apple-specific variables, too. The newest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 12, was designed to improve the performance of older devices. (This was a refreshing change from previous iOS updates, which tended to grind older models to a halt.) With better water resistance and sturdier screens, iPhones are more physically resilient than they used to be. And the list of must-have new features has shrunk. With a few exceptions - like Face ID and animated emojis - there is nothing you can do on a new iPhone that you can't do on one from several years ago.\nApple has also taken a hit from its battery replacement programme, which offered steep discounts to many customers after the company was accused of slowing down older iPhones. That led some users to replace their batteries rather than their entire iPhone.\nAll of this is worrying short-term investors, who want people to buy as many new iPhones as possible. But it's great for people like my mom, who get to keep phones they're happy with and replace them less frequently. It's great for the environment - according to Apple's latest sustainability report, each new Apple device produced generates an average of 90kg of carbon emissions.\nA more durable iPhone could even be great for Apple's long-term profitability. As Brian Barrett points out at Wired: \"An iPhone that lasts longer keeps customers in the iOS ecosystem longer\", and more willing to keep their paid subscriptions to Apple Music, iCloud and other Apple services.\nApple's longer replacement cycle may be a temporary phenomenon, if newer technologies - such as compatibility with 5G mobile networks, which is expected to arrive in iPhones in 2020 - lead to popular apps that don't run on older phones.\nBut for now, while investors might be unhappy with the company's short-term sales, the rest of us should cheer it as a sign of progress in giving customers what they want: sturdy, reliable phones that don't become obsolete as soon as a new model arrives.\nWhen I asked my mom what would get her to upgrade to a newer iPhone, she said she might do it if a new, killer feature came along, or if her favourite apps no longer worked. But in the end, she admitted that wasn't likely. \"Until I drop it and break it, I'll probably keep it,\" she said.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "BACK on Aug\u00a028 I sounded a warning.Storm clouds are brewing over the global technology industry. Worryingly, Apple Inc is among\u00a0the healthiest in the sector.When I first ran the numbers on a selection of nine companies - a mix of branded electronics, product assemblers, and chipmakers - I concluded that the decade-long tech party looked headed for a nasty hangover.I've now added September-quarter figures to the same analysis, which includes inventory levels, turnover and cash conversion cycles. The situation is even uglier than four months ago.Apple's warning this week that it won't meet revenue guidance proves the initial concerns to be true, but it's only a small part of the industry's woes.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Apple adds more suppliers to clean energy programme  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe company's Chinese neme-sis Xiaomi Corp could be in trouble. By the end of September, the maker of smartphones had increased inventories 62 per cent since December 2017 and 22 per cent since June 30. Lest you're tempted to dismiss that as a seasonal inventory build, its 5.3 billion yuan (S$1.05 billion) rise in inventory during that period exceeds the 4.9 billion yuan growth in hardware sales.\nApple, by contrast, cut its inventory to the lowest since June 2017. That includes a 19 per cent reduction from a year prior, which is a better basis of comparison since it accounts for the annual pre-release build cycle. This means that despite the shock guidance cut, which sent shares down 10 per cent on Thursday, the Cupertino-based company is relatively better prepared than others in the industry.\nIntel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co don't look too bad. Yet Samsung's inventory turnover, cash-conversion cycle and inventory-to-cash metrics are all moving in the wrong direction.\nA greater worry is the Taiwanese assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (aka Foxconn), Pegatron Corp and Wistron Corp. Between them, they cover most major electronics brands including Apple, Sony Corp, Nintendo Co, HP Inc and Dell Technologies Inc. Add Lenovo Group Ltd to that mix and you have a continued rise in inventories that can't be supported by the current global economic environment.\nOver the next week the picture for Taiwanese companies will become clearer as they report December monthly sales (due by the 10th of each month), and ergo fourth-quarter revenue.\nIn November, Bloomberg News's Debby Wu reported Foxconn was telling managers that deep cost cuts are coming. Just recently I was told that its non-Apple smartphone division, FIH Mobile Ltd, laid off whole teams of people in Taiwan, with struggles at the company's HMD Global Oyj-Nokia venture among the reasons. Foxconn executives declined to comment.\nSuch trimming may not be enough to save tech companies' bottom lines. As my colleague Shira Ovide wrote, Apple CEO Tim Cook offered some lack-lustre strategies for combating the slowdown at his own company. Others in the industry seem equally bereft of ideas.\nWhile inventories and cash-conversion numbers are historical snapshots, they can also be used as leading indicators for net income. Because the tech industry moves quickly, unsold product left on the shelves too long becomes worthless. And if December and March quarter sales aren't enough to justify those escalating stockpiles, massive asset writeoffs will ensue.

The yen gained about 8 per cent on the Australian dollar, its strongest showing since 2009 while adding 10 per cent on the Turkish lira. This also resulted in the yen being markedly higher against the US dollar.\nCommenting on the depreciation of the US dollar relative to the yen, UOB's senior FX strategist Peter Chia said: \"The sharp move in the USD/JPY that we saw on Thursday morning is probably triggered by stop-loss orders below last May's lows of around 108.11.\"\nShortly after 7.30pm on Thursday, the USD/JPY rate was 107.66.\nIn all, most Asian currencies weakened against the greenback and yen, considered safe havens in times of volatility. But Standard Chartered's Divya Devesh said that the impact on emerging market Asian currencies has been relatively limited thus far.\nGold prices also continued their upward trajectory, hitting a more than six-month high and building on its rally as risk-off attitudes grow. It was trading at US$1,295.26 per ounce shortly after 7.30pm.\nSharing Mr Ng's sentiment, DBS FX strategist Philip Wee noted: \"Since the start of December, spurred by volatility in the equity markets, there has been a clear return to safe haven assets such as the Japanese yen, US treasuries and gold.\"\nWhile not commonplace, \"flash crashes\" like Thursday's have happened in previous years, especially in early Asian trading when liquidity is thin.\nMaybank's head of FX research Saktiandi Supaat, OCBC's Mr Ng and DBS's Mr Wee noted that the pound lost 6 per cent in relation to the US dollar in October 2016 before rebounding amid concerns surrounding Brexit.\nMr Supaat and Mr Wee also cited the yen's sharp appreciation against the New Zealand dollar in August 2015 as another example of a recent \"flash crash\".\nIn the near term, the FX analysts that BT spoke to said that markets may continue to face decelerating growth from economies, especially China.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "San FranciscoAPPLE Inc cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades citing weaker demand in China, triggering a slump for Asian suppliers and a wave of lower price targets on Wall Street.Chief executive officer Tim Cook said sales will be about US$84 billion in the quarter ended Dec 29, down from earlier estimates of US$89 billion to US$93 billion. Apple posted sales of US$88.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter a year earlier, so the new forecast would mean Apple is reporting a holiday quarter slowdown for the first time since Mr Cook became CEO in 2011.Shares of Apple were down 7.8 per cent in pre-market trading in New York on Thursday.The announcement, made in a letter from Mr Cook to investors, comes after weeks of signals from inside Apple and its supply chain indicating the Cupertino, California-based company is struggling to sell the latest iPhones released in September.

That case may be harder to defend now that the collateral damage includes one of America's most recognisable brands.Apple Inc on Wednesday lowered its outlook for first-quarter revenue after a larger-than-expected slowdown in demand from China and fewer upgrades to models of the iPhone. In a letter to investors, chief executive officer Tim Cook said that the company did not expect growth in emerging markets to slow so sharply, especially in China.Apple shares dropped in extended trading, dragging down futures on the broader S&P 500 Index.It is the latest evidence of how tensions between the world's two biggest economies are backfiring on the US, undercutting Mr Trump's assurances that America could continue to grow quickly despite the conflict. At the same time, Chinese growth is decelerating more rapidly than many observers expected, leaving few winners on either side.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Apple adds more suppliers to clean energy programme  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"China's economy is seeing a much sharper slowdown than public data are reporting, which suggests there is much more pressure on Beijing to come to a trade truce than is popularly understood,\" said Leland Miller, CEO of China Beige Book, a data analytics firm that surveys thousands of companies across the Chinese economy. \"On the other hand, the falling US stock market seems to be playing a similar role for President Trump.\"\nData this week showed a worsening picture for China's manufacturing sector.

It will also have taken a chunk out of confidence in the global economy.Investors don't always believe China's official economic data, but they can't brush aside news that iPhone sales in the country have rapidly decelerated, even if Apple is possibly at the sharp end of the slowdown.Chief executive Tim Cook said in a letter to investors that the US tech firm expects US$84 billion of revenue in its latest financial quarter. That's about 8 per cent less than its earlier guidance.Mr Cook said the company was surprised by the magnitude of the economic deceleration in emerging markets, \"particularly in Greater China\", and said that the fall in revenue relative to what was expected is all accounted for by lower iPhone revenue. Markets had already ended 2018 on a wobbly note; Apple shares fell 8 per cent after Wednesday's close.China accounted for nearly 20 per cent of all Apple revenue in the last quarter, so Mr Cook is implying a very sharp fall in Chinese demand.

Newspapers and magazines have continued to struggle. Subscriptions have dwindled for many publications, and ad revenue has shifted to the likes of Google and Facebook Inc.Against that backdrop, Apple is back with another idea that it says will help rescue the industry - and getting a much cooler reception.The tech giant is preparing to relaunch Texture, an app it agreed to buy in March that offers unlimited access to about 200 magazines. The company plans to make it a premium product within Apple News, which curates articles and comes preinstalled on iPhones, according to people familiar with the matter.

After all, it will be promoted on some of the world's most valuable real estate: the screens of more than 1.3 billion devices.\nBut some executives fear Texture could end up doing more harm than good. Their concern is Apple could steal their current subscribers, who would save money by reading articles on Texture instead.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "San Francisco/ShanghaiA CHINESE court has ordered a sales ban of some older Apple Inc iPhone models in China for violating two patents of chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, though intellectual property lawyers said enforcement of the ban was likely still a distant threat.The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two US companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple's business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.Apple said on Monday that all of its phone models remained on sale in mainland China and that it had filed a request for reconsideration with the court, the first step in a long appeal process that could end up at China's Supreme Court.\"It's incredibly unlikely, I'd say almost impossible (that Apple would have to stop sales),\" said a Beijing-based IP lawyer who is not directly connected with the Qualcomm case but has worked with large US tech firms.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Fed signals patience in 2019 amid mounting risks to growth  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"In all likelihood, it will drag on for some time. It's worth keeping in mind that this is just one battle in a larger rift,\" he said, referring to the legal fight between Qualcomm and Apple that stretches from European courts to South Korea.\nQualcomm said in a statement the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S to the X. Apple said the trio of new models released in September were not part of the case.\n\"Qualcomm's effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,\" Apple said.\nTogther, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan make up Apple's third-largest market, accounting for about one-fifth of Apple's US$265.6 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year.\nQualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case in China in late 2017, arguing that Apple infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen. In July, the same court banned the import of some microchips by Micron Technology Inc into China, citing violation of patents held by Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) .\nIn the provincial Chinese court, which is separate from China's specialised intellectual property courts in Beijing, one party can request a ban on an opponent's product without the opponent getting a chance to present a defence.\nIP lawyers said that an appeal process could take the case up to the Fujian provincial high court and then go as far as the Supreme Court in Beijing, a process that would likely take many months given the high-profile nature of the case.\nTo enforce the ban, Qualcomm separately will have to file complaints in what is known as an enforcement tribunal, where Apple will also have a chance to appeal.\nYiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels, said the Chinese injunction could put pressure on Apple to reach a global settlement with Qualcomm. Apple shares rose less than 1 per cent to US$169.60, recovering from an early drop when it became clear phones were still on sale, and Qualcomm stock rose 2.2 per cent to US$57.24.The ruling comes as Beijing and Washington are locked in a tense trade dispute. The two sides have agreed to trade negotiations that must be concluded by March 1 next year. While IP lawyers said the case wasn't directly political, most agreed it could be drawn into broader Sino-US trade tensions, where technology and IP have been a core focus.\nThe specific iPhone models affected by the preliminary ruling in China are the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.\nErick Robinson, a patent lawyer in Beijing and former Qualcomm lawyer, said that while Chinese courts had become fairer in recent years, nationalism could sometimes be a factor in rulings.\nQualcomm is a key technology vendor to China's rising smartphone brands such as Xiaomi Corp, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, while Apple competes directly against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, China's top homegrown maker of premium-priced smartphones, whose CFO was arrested this month for allegedly violating US sanctions.\n\"There is probably a political play here. Apple is a direct competitor to the biggest companies in China, whereas Qualcomm is a supplier,\" Mr Robinson said.

Hon Hai's November revenue of NT$601.4 billion (S$26.7 billion) was a record for the month, and takes January-November sales growth to almost 16 per cent - on track for its fastest pace of annual growth in years.TSMC's sales of NT$98.4 billion, while reflecting a pullback in growth from October, may underscore its rare position of being the sole processor chipmaker for Apple's most expensive gadgets.

Apple is a direct competitor to the biggest companies in China, whereas Qualcomm is a supplier,\" Mr Robinson said.Qualcomm officials said tensions between the two nations had no bearing on the ruling.
