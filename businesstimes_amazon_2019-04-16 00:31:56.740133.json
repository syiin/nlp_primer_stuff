This seems unlikely, as just a two percent cut in soya for animal feed would result in 10 million tonnes less meat per year for the country's burgeoning middle class.\nThe researchers said both history and worrying signals from Brazil's newly installed President Jair Bolsonaro suggested that China's soya deficit will be compensated by greater production in the Amazon.\nFollowing a 1980 US embargo on soya products to the Soviet Union, the amount of land devoted to soya production in Brazil more than doubled between 1990 and 2010, to more than 24 million hectares.\nMr Bolsonaro has sought to limit the land rights of the Amazon's indigenous people and plans to merge the environment and agriculture ministries in moves activists have warned could imperil the rainforest.\nMr Fuchs argued that the US-China trade war had exposed dangerous imbalances in global agriculture.\n\"Over 80 per cent of crop production in the US is maize and soya bean grown in rotation, largely for export,\" he said.\n\"If you have a few producers supplying the world market they become highly vulnerable to trade tensions as we see right now.\"\nAFP\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nChinese imports of soya have already grown twenty times since 2000.\nUsing UN data and consumption trends, exports estimated that the area dedicated to soya production in Brazil could increase by as much as 39 per cent - an additional 13 million hectares.\nThat is a rainforest the size of Greece.\n\"It's quite striking.

A similar product for Google's Android platform is planned for later this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to share the information publicly.The brief video spots appear in response to search results on the shopping app, valuable space for advertisers since people searching for products on the app have a higher propensity to buy than those scrolling through Facebook or watching videos on Google's YouTube.Amazon has emerged as a fast-growing challenger in the digital advertising market since it captures 50 per cent of all online sales in the US. Amazon's digital advertising market share will grow to 8.8 per cent this year from 6.8 per cent in 2018, according to EMarketer Inc. Market-leader Google will see its share slip to 37.2 per cent from 38.2 per cent.Amazon, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.

Many of those video posts on other platforms feature links to sites other than Amazon where shoppers could buy products. Amazon's lack of video content revealed a weakness in shopper engagement and product discovery other sites were doing better.\nThe latest mobile video ad push is a continuation of that effort to put more product videos on the platform.

You may have seen pictures or videos of this scenario online. This is just a small fraction of the behemoth which is the e-commerce industry. Over the past few years, the exponential growth of e-commerce has affected various types of real estate in different degrees.One such impact is the \"Amazon Effect\" which refers to the effects of online e-commerce or digital marketplace on brick-and-mortar retail stores. The Amazon Effect is also blamed for the decline in demand for physical retail space.Most people would commonly associate the e-commerce industry with warehouses where goods and parcels are stored, processed and shipped out. Hence, it is assumed that the rise of the e-commerce industry would increase the demand for logistics properties or warehouses. This assumption will be explored in this report.A warehouse is a large building where raw materials or manufactured goods may be stored prior to their distribution for sale. Currently there is about 10.7 million square metres (sq m) of warehouse space in Singapore, of which a significant indeterminate amount is occupied by the e-commerce industry and its various players.The e-commerce companies in Singapore that use industrial space can be broadly divided into five groups.\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nOnline marketplace platforms are the middle-person platforms for merchants or vendors to list and advertise their products. Some examples of such platforms are eBay, Qoo10, Zalora, Shopee, Lazada, Taobao, Shop-Back and Carousell.\nThese platforms facilitate the online transactions between buyers and merchants. Among the various groups of e-commerce players, they have the smallest physical footprint and are unlikely to occupy any significant warehouse space. The physical space that such online platforms would generally require is likely to be office space for back-end operations.\nStart-up retailers who started their businesses on their own websites and domains. Some prominent examples based in Singapore are Love, Bonito; Fayth; HipVan; FortyTwo and various blogshops that have established a good following for their online brands.\nThese businesses usually do not require much warehouse space as they could use other types of industrial space such as B1 industrial space, which is zoned for light and clean industries, to store their inventories and for their office operations.\nThere is a wider selection of B1 industrial units in terms of sizes and locations compared to warehouse units. Furthermore, it is more economical for small start-up firms to rent a small light industrial unit than a bigger warehouse unit.\nE-commerce retail players with inventories are companies with their own online marketplace platform and hold their own inventory of products. The e-commerce retail players based in Singapore that hold inventories require warehouse space to store their products. The two most prominent examples are Redmart and Amazon.\nCurrently, Redmart has a 14,000 sq m warehouse in Jurong, storing more than 100,000 products including fresh produce, which are delivered to customers from the warehouses after online orders are processed.\nAmazon occupies a 9,300 sq m warehouse near the Jurong district, which is owned by Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT). The Amazon warehouse was opened in 2017.\nThird Party Logistics providers (3PL) - The 3PL are involved in the consolidation and processing of online orders that are shipped out from overseas suppliers. They are responsible for the last-mile delivery that delivers the orders to the customers. Some examples are SingPost, NinjaVan and DHL.\nIn order to store and process items from overseas, locally based third-party logistics providers occupy large warehouses with high ceilings that are able to contain tall racks for efficient processing and storage.\nThese logistics providers require more warehouse space than most of the other e-commerce industry players.\nTraditional retailers that have ventured into e-commerce arguably occupy the largest amount of real estate space in terms of both retail and warehouse space. These businesses have a longer history as traditional brick-and-mortar stores.\nHowever, they ventured into e-commerce in recent years without abandoning their conventional retail space. Their websites or mobile apps allow the customer to purchase online and have the products delivered to the customer directly from their central distribution warehouses.\nSome examples are FairPrice, Challenger and Courts.\nTheir foray into e-commerce does not necessarily generate new demand for warehouses nor contribute to the e-commerce industry's demand for warehouses because these retailers already have their pre-existing warehouses in operation before they ventured into e-commerce. Therefore, venturing into e-commerce helps them to regain some of their market share which has been lost to other e-retailers in recent years.\nAmong the different groups in the e-commerce industry, the 3PL and e-commerce companies, such as Amazon and Redmart, are the biggest new users of warehouse space. The other players may not generate as much new demand for warehouse space in Singapore.\nExamining the warehouse space sector over the past 20 years, total warehouse space stock has doubled from 4.9 million sq m in 1998 to about 10.7 million sq m in 2018. The stock of warehouses increased at the fastest rate from 2013 to 2017, when there were plans for Singapore to be a regional logistics hub. In 2017, a record-breaking 963,000 sq m of new warehouse supply entered the market.\nThe demand for warehouse space was also expanding in the past seven years. From 2014 to 2017, the new demand or net absorption of warehouse space, which averaged 567,700 sq m annually, was especially robust compared to the previous four years of 2010 to 2013, when 209,700 sq m of warehouse space was absorbed annually on average.\nE-commerce in Singapore started to gain traction from 2013. It could have partly contributed to the increase in warehouse demand from 2014 to 2017.\nHowever, the property market was not always able to absorb the supply of new warehouse space in the past seven years. As a result, the overall warehouse occupancy rate declined after reaching the peak of 94.7 per cent in 1Q 2012. In 2017, it fell to 89.1 per cent before it recovered modestly to 89.5 per cent the following year, partly due to the relatively low supply of new warehouse space completed in 2018.\nAlthough e-commerce in Singapore continued to be popular in 2018, the net absorption of warehouse space actually fell 66.4 per cent from 800,100 sq m in 2017 to 268,700 sq m in the following year.\nThis indicated that the demand for warehouse space corresponded more with new supply rather than e-commerce. This is further illustrated by the high correlation coefficient of 0.86 between new supply and new demand for warehouse space.\nDespite the impressive growth of e-commerce industry in recent years, it did not always result in a corresponding increase in demand for warehouse space.\nThis is because in the e-commerce industry, the majority of the players do not require significant warehouse space. Furthermore, some of the items bought through e-commerce are shipped directly from foreign vendors to Singapore customers and occupy local warehouse storage only briefly.\nHowever, the demand for warehouses does not depend solely on e-commerce. There are many other industries that utilise warehouses in Singapore.\nIn conclusion, the growth in e-commerce does not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in demand for warehouse space.\nJust as e-commerce and online shopping is expected to evolve over time, so would the use and types of warehouse space. We can expect greater innovative use of new technology such as robotics and automation in the pursuit of greater productivity of warehouse space.\nNicholas Mak is the executive director at ZACD Group.

The companies are already inserting themselves between the bank and its customers as people increasingly turn to the technology giants when shopping for financial services, Mr McKay said.\"They are getting between us and the moments of truth of our customers, and currently what they do with that is they sell that insight back to us in the form of search and advertising and other perspectives, and they earn a certain amount of economic rent,\" Mr McKay said at the RBC Financial Institutions Conference in New York.

Amid the uproar, Vijay Shekhar Sharma - whose two-year-old Paytm Mall is backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - is quietly devising ways to outstrip his rivals.The new regime forbids retailers from holding any business interest in online merchants on their websites, exclusive arrangements and deep discounts - forcing Amazon and Flipkart to redraw contracts and rescue thousands of product listings that vanished overnight. The founder of Paytm Mall operator Paytm E-commerce Pvt, an affiliate of India's largest digital payments provider, spoke in an interview this week about how his business stands to gain.What's been the impact of the regulations on your business?The new rules require more stringent adherence by e-commerce marketplaces.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "ON Nov 13, 2018, Amazon announced that New York would become one of two locations for the company's second North American headquarters, ending a competition that had involved more than 200 places, including cities as diverse as Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Newark and Austin, Texas.But there was hardly any cheering in New York. State Senator Michael Gianaris and other leaders protested that the agreement was bad for New York and bad for its people. They argued that it is absurd for city and state taxpayers to subsidise one of the world's most valuable companies, owned by the world's richest man, with as much as US$3 billion in taxpayer money.They are right about one thing. It is absurd that any city would agree to such a deal. But this is how the game is played. Paying companies to relocate has been the American way since 1936, when Mississippi established the nation's first state-sponsored economic development plan. Under that plan, since followed by many other jurisdictions, cities and states agreed to pay companies to relocate by promising them new factories and low or non-existent taxes. With those inducements, numerous businesses relocated in the decades after World War II, usually from the union-dominated Northeast and Midwest to the business-friendly South.In this historical context, New York's deal for Amazon is not a bad deal at all. But its opponents have condemned it, partly because the negotiations were held in secret and because the constituents most involved in the decision were not consulted. Absent serious renegotiations, they want Amazon to take its promise of 25,000 new jobs somewhere else. The greatest city in the world, they say, need not kneel before capitalist royalty.Can the Empire City really afford to turn away from this opportunity?\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nClearly, New York has overcome dozens of economic crises in its nearly four centuries of history. It was almost destroyed by fire in 1776 and 1778, and in 1835, the Great Fire of New York destroyed more than 600 structures and most of what is now Lower Manhattan. The 1863 Draft Riot took at least 100 lives and continues to rank as the worst civil disturbance in American history. The 1977 blackout resulted in widespread looting and property destruction - the low point in a dark period.\nAnd the worst of all, in terms of the loss of human life, was the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, which killed 2,753 people. The attack also destroyed more than 10 million square feet of real estate, and the resulting crisis cost the region 223,000 jobs in just two years.\nThe potential loss of the Amazon headquarters would be more akin to a long-term disaster. During the 20th century, the city lost its two main economic underpinnings: its manufacturing base and its role as the busiest seaport on earth. In 1955, for example, about a million people worked in New York City's factories, and in its crowded harbour, tramp steamers, ocean liners and tugboats struggled to avoid one another. New York was the leading industrial city in the world.\nAnd yet, by 1980, a quarter-century later, the major job centres in the five boroughs had essentially collapsed. In 1900, New York had 90 breweries and was the beer capital of the nation. But by 1976, the last brewery in the city was gone, and Milwaukee and St Louis were competing for beer supremacy. Similarly, in 1950, New York's 300,000 textile workers made most of the women's clothes sold in the United States. The city had no serious rival. But by 2017, only about 20,000 such workers remained.\nNew York's job losses were not only blue-collar. During the 1970s, the city experienced an exodus of Fortune 500 corporations. Dozens of them moved their headquarters and took their executives with them. Some went to suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey, but many more decamped for Atlanta, Dallas or Houston. The impact on the city was dramatic. Not only did workers laid off from those companies lose their jobs, but their spouses and children suffered as well. Many of them, as demographic statistics reveal, had to move to other states to make a living. Their departure was hidden by the fact that they were often replaced by millions of newcomers from other countries, but those immigrants could not immediately compensate for all those lost jobs.\nThe region now faces a calamity almost as bad as anything that has happened in the past. The loss of Amazon would cost 25,000 jobs directly, and those workers would support up to 82,000 more indirect jobs. The subsidies New York has offered to Amazon would have been given to any company promising so many jobs. And Amazon is expected to pay more than US$27 billion in taxes over the next 25 years. Amazon will also build four million square feet of office space in Queens, providing billions more in construction spending.\nMore important, a new Amazon headquarters on the East River would signal that the future of this metropolis is as great as its past.\nIf Mr Gianaris and his supporters have their way, and Amazon retreats to Nashville or Atlanta or some other more welcoming city, the mail order house that Jeff Bezos built will probably suffer little. But New York will lose its reputation as a centre of economic opportunity, and the city will sink in status and importance. And its legislators and politicians will solidify their reputation as the most overpaid and incompetent in the nation.\nAmazon's opponents should take a longer-term view. If there is no economic opportunity, there are no jobs. If there are no jobs, there is no tax revenue. And without taxes, jobs and opportunity, New York will no longer be first among cities.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "SeattleWHEN a chain of physical therapy centres wanted new patients, it aimed online ads at people near its offices who had bought knee braces recently on Amazon.When a financial services provider wanted to promote its retirement advisory business, it directed ads to people in their 40s and 50s who had recently ordered a personal finance book from Amazon.And when a major credit card company wanted new customers, it targeted people who used cards from other banks on the retail site.The advertisers found those people by using Amazon's advertising services, which leverage what the company knows better than anyone: consumers' online buying habits.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"Amazon has a really straightforward database - they know what I buy,\" said Daniel Knijnik, co-founder of Quartile Digital, an Amazon-focused ad agency that oversaw the ads for the clinics and retirement services. \"For an advertiser, that's a dream.\"\nAds sold by Amazon, once a limited offering at the company, can now be considered a third major pillar of its business, along with e-commerce and cloud computing. Amazon's advertising business is worth about US$125 billion, more than Nike or IBM, Morgan Stanley estimated. At its core are ads placed on Amazon.com by makers of toilet paper or soap that want to appear near product search results on the site.\nBut many ad agencies are particularly excited by another area of advertising that is less obvious to many consumers. The company has been steadily expanding its business of selling video or display ads - the square and rectangular ads on sites across the Web - and gaining ground on the industry leaders, Google and Facebook.\nIn addition to knowing what people buy, Amazon also knows where people live, because they provide delivery addresses, and which credit cards they use. It knows how old their children are from their baby registries, and who has a cold, right now, from cough syrup ordered for two-hour delivery. And the company has been expanding a self-service option for ad agencies and brands to take advantage of its data on shoppers.\n\"That is where the insane scale can happen for the business,\" said John Denny, a vice-president at CAVU Venture Partners, which invests in consumer brands such as Bulletproof coffee and Hippeas chickpea puffs.\nMajor online ad networks offer different ways to target customers. A brand that sells running shirts for women might turn to Google to find people whom the company believes are female and interested in running based on their search and browsing history. The company may turn to Facebook for people in a women's running group.\nMany of Amazon's features are similar to those of Google or Facebook, such as offering ways to target users based on their interests, searches and demographics. But Amazon's ad system can also remove a lot of the guesswork by showing ads to people who have bought the shirts on Amazon.com.\nAdvertisers have long run some targeted campaigns through Amazon's ad network. Many have done that by working directly with Amazon's staff, who would place their orders on their behalf. That option has historically been focused on larger brands because it requires a minimum advertising commitment. Over time, Amazon has given more advertisers and their agencies access to the self-service system to run their own targeting campaigns on and off Amazon's websites, and at a variety of spending levels.\nUsers of the self-service system can choose from hundreds of automated audience segments. Some of Amazon's targeting capabilities are dependent on shopping behaviours, such as \"International Market Grocery Shopper\" and people who have bought \"Acne Treatments\" in the past month, or household demographics, such as \"Presence of children aged 4-6\". Others are based on the media that people consume on Amazon, such as \"Denzel Washington Fans\" or people who have recently streamed fitness and exercise videos on Amazon. The company declined to comment.\nJust the Cheese, a company in Reeseville, Wisconsin, makes crunchy dried cheese bars that have taken off as a low-carb snack. By using algorithms to analyse how Just the Cheese's search ads performed on Amazon's site, the ad agency Quartile Digital noticed that people who searched for keto snacks and cauliflower pizza crust, both low-carb diet trends, also bought a lot of cheese bars. So Quartile ran display ads across the Web targeting Amazon customers who had bought those two specific product categories.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "HELLO, Amazon? Are you there? If ever there was a moment for an international retailing behemoth to pick up a British store chain, this is it.While Christmas trading didn't turn out to be the bloodbath that many - including myself - had feared, valuations remain in the doldrums.The FTSE 350 General Retailers Index has bounced since the end of December, as the big store groups avoided nasty profit warnings. But even so, it is down about 20 per cent from its 2018 high.\u00a0A weaker pound is also helpful.Within this, there are some individual horror stories. A prime example is Asos plc, the purveyor of playsuits to millennial shoppers, which delivered a severe earnings downgrade in December.Amazon.com Inc has long struggled to crack fashion, and snapping up Asos\u00a0would solve this problem in one fell swoop.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nAnd given that its enterprise value has dropped from more than \u00a36 billion (S$10.5 billion) in March 2018 to just \u00a32.5\u00a0billion, the company has now become as affordable as its clothes.\nAmazon's market capitalisation of about US$800 billion makes buying Asos the equivalent of popping a cheap satin mini-skirt in its shopping basket - even including a takeover premium. Then there's grocery. Amazon's US$13.6 billion purchase of Whole Foods only gave it a tiny UK presence.\u00a0\nBulking up in Britain could be possible if the Internet giant looked to emulate that 2017 deal by bolstering its physical presence and its online grocery business, Amazon Fresh.\nAlthough the listed supermarkets' valuations have also recovered recently, they are still lower than six months ago. Buying Tesco plc, Britain's biggest supermarket, would transform Amazon's grocery business,\u00a0giving it massive scale and a food supply chain capable of handling fresh produce across the UK.\nThe smaller players could also be suitable. Amazon already sells Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc products, so a deal would be a matter of expanding that link.\nMeanwhile, if J Sainsbury Plc's \u00a37 billion purchase of Walmart Inc's Asda collapses\u00a0it would be vulnerable -\u00a0and appealing, given that it has both a food business and the non-food Argos arm.\nThere are question marks. With Tesco, Amazon would get around 3,000 UK stores\u00a0serving\u00a0a broad range of customers, not just those affluent consumers who might subscribe to Amazon Prime. Buying either it or Sainsbury would also spark competition concerns.\nAlthough Amazon is still small in food, both potential targets have big non-food businesses that regulators would need to scrutinise. Still, there is another potential target that stands out: Marks & Spencer Group plc.\nIt offers fresh food and is well known for its private label products, such as pre-prepared meals and indulgent desserts. It also brings a clothing arm.\nWhile the brand has struggled to strike the right note with customers, there are signs of improvement, and there there is no denying that even with its travails M&S has some solid apparel skills.\nAmazon need not be the only American giant to get involved. Atlanta-based Home Depot Inc could find an opportunity in\u00a0Kingfisher plc. The home-improvement chain's\u00a0five-year plan to lift annual profit has so far delivered little benefit to investors - the shares are down almost a third since chief executive officer Veronique Laury unveiled her strategy in January 2016.\nTrue, Home Depot is focused solely on North America right now. And any international predator might be put off by the recent experience of Australia's Wesfarmers Ltd, which botched the takeover of Britain's Homebase.\nBut everything has a price. And if Kingfisher's valuation continues to slide, then a muscular rival might just be tempted.\nAnd let's not leave bling behind. With Tapestry Inc and Capri Holdings Ltd seeking to build conglomerates, any failure to reignite sales at Burberry Group plc could put the British luxury\u00a0brand on their shopping lists.\nThe hurdle to any of these scenarios is that even with the slump in share prices, it would still take a brave soul to buy a British retailer right now.

They are also forbidden from entering into exclusive deals with sellers.The rules, which come into force on Feb 1, will particularly hit Amazon, which has invested billions of dollars in its India operation, and Flipkart, which was taken over this year by another US giant, Walmart.The government acted in response to complaints from brick and mortar retailers that e-commerce giants were unfairly selling products at discount prices.Indian law already prevents foreign-owned companies from selling directly on their internet sites.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: India's Jet extends cancellations after lenders fail to release funds  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nSo the e-commerce companies have been buying in bulk and then selling the products to favoured vendors. These then resell the products at discount on the e-commerce sites who legally remain intermediaries.\nAmazon and Walmart, which in May bought a 77 per cent stake in Indian company Flipkart for US$16 billion, will be worst hit by the new rules. Neither has made a public reaction.\nSnapdeal, one of India's biggest Internet shopping sites, said the changes would enable a level playing field for all sellers.\n\"Marketplaces are meant for genuine, independent sellers, many of whom are MSMEs (Micro, small and medium enterprises),\" Snapdeal founder Kunal Bahl said on Twitter.\nThe Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said the new policy would end discounting wars between e-retailers.\nIt would also check big companies from using \"the policy of exclusivity, predatory pricing and deep discounting\" to their advantage, CAIT secretary Praveen Khandelwal told AFP.\nThe new rules will start on Feb 1 when the nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi announces its interim budget ahead of a general election due by May.\nAnalysts said the rule would have a major impact on the business models built up over the the last five years by the US giants as they make inroads in India's growing market.\n\"Amazon, Walmart and other players with their India investments will have to rethink their business strategies,\" Satish Meena from Forrester Research told AFP.\n\"Consumers will face the brunt and prices will go up while available options will go down.\"\nThe Indian government has in the past two years sought to strengthen home-grown enterprises against foreign competition.\nIt has told credit card companies such as Visa, American Express and Mastercard that all information on Indians must be stored on India-based computers.\nThe government has also proposed limits on what internet giants can do with personal data.\nIt recently proposed that the WhatsApp messaging app break its trademark encryption which guarantees private communications between users.

Panic set in fast in the middle of this month when she realised she had just six days to get presents before visiting her parents.She found a few cute things on Etsy - \"beautiful, handcrafted gifts\", she said - and then realised they would take about four weeks to arrive. \"I was like, ok, Amazon Prime it is!\" she said.An Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a statement in which the vice-president who runs Prime, Cem Sibay, said, \"We keep working to add faster and even more convenient delivery options.\"Amazon now has over 110 fulfilment centres in North America, more than 250,000 warehouse employees and dozens of its own planes. It is setting up warehouses that hold tens of millions of items closer to major cities, letting it offer free same-day and one-day shipping on more products. Walmart and others have also made strides in catching the wave of shoppers moving online by making similar delivery promises without the cost of a Prime membership. (In the third quarter, Walmart's online sales rose 43 per cent over the previous year.)A Google search for the retailer on Wednesday returned \"Walmart Last Minute Gifts | Get 'em by Christmas | Free 2-Day Shipping\" for the name of the company's home page. These traditional retailers are leveraging their physical stores - a key advantage they have over Amazon - and providing ways for people to order online and pick up in person. That is particularly powerful in the final days before Christmas, when shoppers return to stores.\"The biggest area that we're playing offensive right now is with our stores,\" Marc Lore, who runs Walmart's US e-commerce business, told investors in October.Amazon is faster than every major competitor, though other retailers are speeding up. In 2016, Old Navy, which is owned by Gap, took about 10 days to deliver a package ordered during the week after Thanksgiving, Rakuten data shows.This year, its packages showed up about three days faster. Walmart cut its delivery time from more than a week to six days over the same period. And Best Buy said 80 per cent of its small packages now arrive in two days or under. (Rakuten's data excludes eBay and Etsy because the formats of their electronic receipts are harder to track.)Yet, most retailers still have to work to win people's trust. Jessica Palazzo, who runs after-school programmes near Hartford, Connecticut, bought her mother pajamas from Old Navy two years ago that were guaranteed to arrive before Christmas, but which didn't appear until January. Old Navy offered her 10 per cent off her next order.This year on Black Friday, she put a pair of Gap pajamas into her online shopping cart - but then had a change of heart. \"That's embarrassing if you come on Christmas and have nothing for somebody,\" Ms Palazzo said. She ended up buying running socks and a running ear warmer for her mother from Amazon. NYTIMESSPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD. REGN NO. 198402668E"], "22 Dec 2018": ["JEFF Bezos captured the world's imagination when he appeared on CBS's 60 Minutes and pledged to fill the skies with package delivery drones.Five years on, Amazon.com Inc's chief executive officer is betting on decidedly more terrestrial technology: drivers. As in real people. Tens of thousands of them. High-tailing it through town in gas-slurping vans to leave packages on doorsteps just like the milk man, postal worker, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) guy and pizza dude before them.Mr Bezos this summer issued a call-to-arms to aspiring entrepreneurs, offering them a chance to earn US$300,000 a year by starting their own businesses making Amazon deliveries. All for as little as US$10,000 up front, far less than the US$250,000 it takes to open a fast-food franchise like McDonald's or the US$1 million required to buy a typical FedEx delivery business.Instead of charting a future that makes drivers obsolete, Amazon is so dependent on them it's copying FedEx Corp to build a network of independent couriers around the United States in a frantic effort to keep pace with demand that peaks in December. To entice interest, Amazon uses its bargaining power to get partners good deals on vans and insurance and offers them a steady stream of packages.Legally murky terrain\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe Bezos proteges take on the biggest challenge of all: recruiting and hiring drivers willing to meet Amazon's high standards for low pay. All when there are plenty of other jobs to pick from.\nThe effort puts Amazon in legally murky terrain where it has to be careful how much control it exerts over people employed by different companies. The company already faces multiple lawsuits from delivery drivers claiming to be stiffed wages by Amazon partners. Those workers say Amazon is on the hook, as well, since they toil on the company's behalf. But the risks could be worth it if Amazon finds a legal way to add drivers and vans without spending its own money. The model gives it far more negotiating power over each small business partner than it has with UPS, FedEx and the postal service.\n\"There's all these futuristic visions of drones delivering things and robots delivering things, but all of that innovation flies in the face of some sort of regulation and those regulations move very slowly,\" says Mike Howell, CEO of the on-demand delivery company Dolly. \"Amazon doesn't have time to wait for drones. It has to pursue this old-guard model now more out of necessity than out of desire.\"\nSo far, Amazon has attracted tens of thousands of aspirants eager for a ground-floor opportunity serving the fast-growing company led by the world's wealthiest man. Applicants go through phone interviews followed by several days of training. In just a few months, hundreds of new businesses have sprouted up around the country that employ thousands of drivers. Even more hopefuls are on a waitlist eager for Amazon to expand further next year.\nRiccardo Drago is among the new partners. He had been making deliveries through Amazon Flex, an Uber-type application that lets people deliver Amazon packages in their own cars. He and his wife, Judy, always dreamed of starting their own business, so they accepted an offer from Amazon to help test the new delivery partner concept last year before it was announced.\nMr Drago was eager to make a good impression on his first day, but there was a big problem. He had only two of the five vans he ordered, and his company was assigned five routes. Amazon offered to divert the packages, but Mr Drago put two workers in each van, doubled their loads and did one of the routes in his own Hummer.\nWhen he returned to the warehouse thinking he was finished, an Amazon manager asked him: \"Hey Riccardo, how much do you love me? Will you do one more route for me?\" Without baulking, Mr Drago threw dozens of additional packages in his car, raced through Denver and upon his return to the warehouse less than an hour later, collapsed on the floor. \"I became the talk of Amazon after that,\" he says.\nMr Drago's business now has a motto: \"We don't give up routes. Ever.\" And his drivers will double up on packages to cover for co-workers who are sick or falling behind.\nThat's the can-do spirit Mr Bezos is counting on to meet insatiable demand from Amazon shoppers without breaking the bank. The Dragos now have 42 vans and 70 employees who each deliver about 250 packages in a typical day. Their profit is about US$40,000 each month, about US$1,000 per van, Mr Drago says. The biggest challenge is hiring and retaining drivers, who earn about US$150 for each eight-hour shift.\n\"Denver has low unemployment,\" Judy Drago says. \"So it's tough to find drivers.\" He husband says he keeps them motivated with gestures like serving homemade Italian meatballs at the end of shifts.\nThe FedEx way\nIf the FedEx experience is any guide, the Dragos and others could be building valuable businesses. Buyers for FedEx parcel delivery routes can be found in as little as a few weeks, says Tony DiNitto, who once operated routes and now advises people who want to buy their own.\nThe price for FedEx routes have climbed over the last five years to about 3.3 times cash earnings from about 2 times. The average number of routes sold by owners is about 10 at an average price of just under US$1 million, he says. One route typically earns about US$25,000 a year before taxes, providing a payback on investment in three or four years. \"I don't know of a better business to buy than FedEx routes,\" Mr DiNitto adds. \"The revenue is very stable and growing. The valuation of the business itself has slowly and continuously grown over the last decade.\"\nThat model has been good for FedEx, as well. The company has 5,600 service partners who employ nearly 50,000 people, providing \"increased service capacity and operational flexibility\", the company said in a statement.\nWhile FedEx wants partners, it doesn't let any of them get too big and usually limits the number of routes to about 30, according to Mr DiNitto. Amazon is capping most of its delivery partners at about 40 vans, though some exceed that limit to meet demand.\nAmazon is mostly a victim of its own success. The company has 97 million US Prime members who pay monthly and annual fees in exchange for fast delivery, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Those customers have little incentive to consolidate their orders to make shipping more economical.\nShipping is one of Amazon's fastest-growing expenses and consistently outpaces online sales growth. The company must find cheaper ways to deliver packages or its e-commerce business could be unsustainable without further price hikes.\nAmazon increased the yearly cost of Prime membership by 20 per cent this year to US$120, the first hike since 2014. Any company delivering packages for Amazon has to pay for vehicles, gas and insurance.\nA key way for Amazon's new partners to keep delivery costs down while making a profit is to pay drivers less than the competition. UPS's union drivers earn a top wage of nearly US$80,000 a year, excluding overtime, plus health-care and pension benefits. Those wages will go up 9.4 per cent in 2022. Median annual pay for union postal workers is US$57,000. Most FedEx contractors pay drivers about US$40,000 a year and some offer healthcare benefits. FedEx drivers aren't unionised and turnover is higher than UPS, which has a waiting list to become a driver.\nAmazon, which announced in October that all of its warehouse workers would be paid at least US$15 an hour, doesn't dictate how much delivery partners pay drivers. Interviews with two Amazon delivery partners indicate full-time drivers earn between US$30,000 and US$40,000 a year excluding overtime.\nRecruiting, hiring and training\nBeyond saving on pay, the delivery partner model lets Amazon train the owner once, who then bears the cost of recruiting, hiring and training the rest of the drivers in a high-turnover business. That can cost up to US$4,000 per person, says Atif Siddiqi, CEO at Branch Messenger. \"Finding and retaining people is very costly right now,\" he explains. \"But they shouldn't have a hard time finding people who want to start their own businesses and run things.\"\nBlake Vaughn jumped at the chance to start an Amazon delivery business in Fort Worth, Texas, this summer. After a few phone interviews, he was off to a week-long training in Seattle and officially launched Patriot DSP in October. He has more than 50 vans and employs almost 100 drivers who make at least US$15 an hour plus bonuses and benefits.\nA Navy veteran, Mr Vaughn received US$10,000 from Amazon to offset startup costs. The company earmarked US$1 million to entice veterans to start businesses. Mr Vaughn was impressed with all the groundwork Amazon had done to get him up and running right away, things he had to do on his own with a previous franchise business. Amazon had pre-negotiated deals with Indeed.com for job postings, financing and insurance for vehicles, health benefits for employees and devices and wireless service to help drivers navigate routes, all at rates better than he could get on his own. \"That's the beauty of having this enormous Amazon structure behind you,\" he points out.\nAmazon pays Mr Vaughn up to US$1,800 per vehicle each month, US$24 per employee hour and then an additional amount per package, leaving it up to him to manage the business profitably. Mr Vaughn expects to have a profit margin of 10 per cent to 14 per cent on about US$1 million in revenue in his first three months and says margins should improve once he's more established.\nMr Vaughn spends about US$3,000 a month advertising job openings on Indeed and hired a manager with a background in recruiting and human resources. He interviews about 40 drivers each month and hires about 30 of them.To instill camaraderie and keep turnover down, he pays for catered gatherings and bowling nights. Employees who put in extra effort when their colleagues get sick or fall behind get bonuses to make sure hiccups don't delay packages.\nKeeping an eye on the law\nSmaller businesses, often family run, tend to be more productive than hourly employees working for a big company, according to Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants. Workers will be less finicky about working nights, weekends and holidays, and they're not a big target for union organisers that can drive wages up by 20 per cent.\nIf Amazon hired thousands of delivery drivers around the country, it would be a magnet for union organisers, Mr Farhi says. \"They'll just cut a few more corners, like driving faster between stops, because the incentives are in place to do so. A self-employed workforce seems to be a bit hungrier.\"\nAmazon's new delivery model has already come under fire in lawsuits alleging its partners have skirted overtime laws by paying drivers daily rates rather than hourly wages. One case filed this month in Illinois calls the programme an \"unlawful scheme to attempt to avoid responsibility for paying\" delivery drivers.\nFedEx was forced to pay a US$13 million settlement for lawsuits that claimed \"misclassification\" of workers as independent contractors cost them wages. In response to those lawsuits, FedEx now requires its service providers to have drivers on payroll. Still, more lawsuits on behalf of drivers in several US states are challenging FedEx's new terms. Amazon paid a similar settlement regarding the use of independent contractors in a California lawsuit that alleged contract delivery drivers were shortchanged.\nThe biggest challenge is finding people willing to do quality work at low wages. Home security footage frequently shows delivery people throwing and even punting packages toward homes. \"The primary problem is finding people willing to do this work for US$15 an hour who won't hurl packages 30 feet towards a porch from the van window,\" says Marc Wulfraat, president of the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc. \"It doesn't matter how many entrepreneurs Amazon throws at this, that problem remains.\"\nThese are the challenges Mr Bezos & Co will be forced to endure - at least until fleets of robot drones take to the skies.

Employees who put in extra effort when their colleagues get sick or fall behind get bonuses to make sure hiccups don't delay packages.Keeping an eye on the lawSmaller businesses, often family run, tend to be more productive than hourly employees working for a big company, according to Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants. Workers will be less finicky about working nights, weekends and holidays, and they're not a big target for union organisers that can drive wages up by 20 per cent.If Amazon hired thousands of delivery drivers around the country, it would be a magnet for union organisers, Mr Farhi says. \"They'll just cut a few more corners, like driving faster between stops, because the incentives are in place to do so. A self-employed workforce seems to be a bit hungrier.\"Amazon's new delivery model has already come under fire in lawsuits alleging its partners have skirted overtime laws by paying drivers daily rates rather than hourly wages. One case filed this month in Illinois calls the programme an \"unlawful scheme to attempt to avoid responsibility for paying\" delivery drivers.FedEx was forced to pay a US$13 million settlement for lawsuits that claimed \"misclassification\" of workers as independent contractors cost them wages. In response to those lawsuits, FedEx now requires its service providers to have drivers on payroll. Still, more lawsuits on behalf of drivers in several US states are challenging FedEx's new terms. Amazon paid a similar settlement regarding the use of independent contractors in a California lawsuit that alleged contract delivery drivers were shortchanged.The biggest challenge is finding people willing to do quality work at low wages. Home security footage frequently shows delivery people throwing and even punting packages toward homes. \"The primary problem is finding people willing to do this work for US$15 an hour who won't hurl packages 30 feet towards a porch from the van window,\" says Marc Wulfraat, president of the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc. \"It doesn't matter how many entrepreneurs Amazon throws at this, that problem remains.\"These are the challenges Mr Bezos & Co will be forced to endure - at least until fleets of robot drones take to the skies.

Columbia University handed out 724 graduate degrees in computer science over the past three years. And 10 potential land parcels in Long Island City are zoned M1-4, for light manufacturing.New York provided all of these data points, and thousands more, to Amazon as part of its successful bid to woo the tech giant to town.On Monday, New York City posted online the 253-page proposal it submitted, along with New York state, to Amazon in March. The city quickly took the file down, saying it should have checked with its partners before posting it, because the document included proprietary information. But The New York Times downloaded the document before it was taken off the public website.The proposal shows the types of data, some rarely available publicly, that the company amassed from cities across the country as part of its search for a second headquarters.In the end, Amazon chose Long Island City in Queens and Arlington, Virginia, for two new headquarters. But more than 200 cities put in initial bids for the project, and 20 of them provided Amazon with more information when they made Amazon's shortlist. Each submitted valuable research that the company can mine in the future for picking satellite offices, warehouse locations or research hubs.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nWhen Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, first scrolled through New York's submission, which The Times asked him to review, one word kept flying out his mouth: \"Wow\".\nMr Parilla, who researches economic development, was amazed at the level of detail and hard-to-find data the city had provided. \"We are doing a project right now that, if we had access to Amazon's database, it would make our life so much easier,\" Mr Parilla said.\nAn Amazon spokesman, Adam Sedo, said most of the information the company received was publicly available, and economic development offices regularly provided such data to companies looking to locate in an area.\nHere is a look at what Amazon obtained, and how the company did it.\nWhat did Amazon ask for?\nIn September 2017, Amazon put out an eight-page request for proposals from cities and states.

New York's first proposal included a rendering of a building with Amazon's logo shining in the skyline.\nAfter Amazon announced its shortlist in January, it gave cities a 29-page request for information that required far more precision and was more about practicalities than flash. It asked cities to respond by early March with a huge text document punctuated only with a few maps.\nWhat information did New York initially provide?\nIn its first proposal, New York offered to use eminent domain to help Amazon get necessary land, and highlighted four city neighbourhoods for a new Amazon headquarters, including in the World Trade Center complex and the redeveloped Farley Post Office in Midtown West.

Soon after going on sale earlier this year, Apple cut some HomePod orders with suppliers. Since then, it has added new features like the ability to summon an iPhone's location and make calls. BLOOMBERG\nApple will sell 3.5 million HomePods this year, compared with 28.5 million Echos and 16.2 million Google Home speakers, making Amazon the best partner to help increase Apple Music subscriptions, according to Loup Ventures. Apple Music currently has more than 50 million subscribers. The service is a key component of Apple's plan to expand digital services revenue and offset slowing growth of iPhone unit sales.Amazon chief executive officer Jeff Bezos cares more about increasing the number of people using Alexa and Echo speakers than he does about selling phones or music subscriptions. Last month, the e-commerce giant began selling the latest Apple iPhones, Watches and iPads on its website. One notable exclusion is the HomePod.It's unclear if the two moves are related. But the e-commerce deal could spur more purchases of Apple devices by Amazon customers. While Amazon is the market leader in smart speakers, the company's efforts to design and sell its own smartphone flopped, and it doesn't sell pricey tablets like the iPad or high-end wearables like the Apple Watch.This isn't the first time Apple is leveraging other hardware makers to boost Apple Music. When it launched the service in 2015, it released a version that works on Android. Apple hasn't said how many users it has on Android, but the app has been downloaded more than 10 million times, according to the Google Play store's website. Apple also offers integration with Sonos speakers for its music service.Apple hasn't announced a similar partnership with Google for its Home speakers. Google competes directly with the iPhone with its Pixel devices, and Android is the main rival for Apple's iOS mobile operating system.Amazon and Google have clashed in similar ways, with Google pulling YouTube from Echo speakers last year when Amazon didn't sell Google Chromecast video streaming gadgets.

It described the arrangement of products on shelves \u2014 unlikely juxtapositions determined wholly by algorithm.A worker's life was disorienting; you never knew where anything might be. Nail clippers might be next to stone humidifiers or HVAC filters or picture frames. The worker was given a product location and ran to it. Then another. And again. The warehouse was a game, the products little more than flippers in search of a pinball to thwack.This holiday season, you are the pinball.Amazon has recently opened Amazon 4-Star, a catchall gift shop in SoHo \u2014 about 100 feet from Balthazar and the MoMA Design Store \u2014 that's part of the company's slow seep into physical retail. It is grim. A permanent store with the harried, colourless mood of a hastily assembled clearance-sale pop-up.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "San FranciscoAMAZON.COM Inc has taken a big step towards reducing reliance on Intel Corp for a critical component of its cloud-computing service.The largest cloud company unveiled its own server processors late on Monday and said the Graviton chips will support new versions of its main EC2 cloud-computing service. Until now, Amazon - and other big cloud operators - had almost exclusively used Intel Xeon chips.Other attempts have so far failed to loosen Intel's mighty grip on the server chip market. But Amazon is using a discounting strategy that has helped it win customers time and time again. The company said the Graviton-backed cloud service is available at a \"significantly lower cost\" than existing offerings run on Intel processors.Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers estimated that the new service will be up to 45 per cent cheaper than the equivalent offering based on Intel chips. \"This will add another competitive question on Intel's positioning within AWS Cloud,\" he wrote in a research note on Tuesday.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nIt's the second time this month that Amazon has taken a swing at Intel's server chip business. The cloud provider said on Nov 6 that it's offering services based on computers that use Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) processors. That marked a breakthrough for AMD's efforts to compete against Intel.\nAmazon still expects Intel to be the major provider of chips for its cloud servers and high-end computing, said Matt Garman, a vice-president at Amazon Web Services. But it decided to spend the money on creating its own designs because it saw a use case for rival technology and has the scale to make it worthwhile.\n\"We absolutely want to differentiate ourselves and meet any and all use cases that our customers come up with,\" Mr Garman said in an interview.\nIntel processors run more than 98 per cent of the world's servers, and owners of massive data centres such as Amazon, Microsoft Corp and Google have become some of its biggest customers.\nWhile these Internet giants have driven down the price of most components by doing a lot of their own engineering, Intel's Xeon chips have resisted that pressure. The average selling price of these processors has risen over time, something that almost never happens in the electronic industry.\nAnalysts have speculated for years that these cloud companies would use their large R&D budgets and increasing technical abilities to find alternatives to Intel chips. They have come up with specific-use chips of their own, but Amazon's Graviton is the first example of a major player using its own gear to replace a set of cloud workloads normally handled by an Intel Xeon processor.\nAmazon is using its 2015 acquisition of startup Annapurna Labs to design its own chips.

It is one of very few large American corporations that is choosing to retain its profits and reinvest them rather than cut payrolls and distribute corporate cash to shareholders as dividends and buybacks.Most Americans know Amazon through the consumer end of its business, with tens of thousands of low-wage workers handling orders at distribution sites around the country. It would be a mistake, however, to see Amazon's growth as driven primarily by low-wage employment. While most of its revenues come from the sale of low-priced products, most of its profits come from its cloud computing operation, Amazon Web Services.This high-tech division, which has made Amazon the world leader in cloud computing, accounted for less than 10 per cent of Amazon's revenues last year, but generated US$4.3 billion in operating income. By comparison, North American web sales, which accounted for 60 per cent of revenue, generated only US$2.8 billion in profit.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe Web Services Division has transformed Amazon into an enormously profitable company.

(Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive is the largest.)

REGN NO. 198402668E"], "15 Nov 2018": ["[NEW YORK] Two years ago, Matt Kelly could not have known that a failed merger involving his real estate firm would propel him towards a central role in Amazon's expansion plans.In May 2016, Mr Kelly and his firm, then known as the JBG Companies, had an agreement to merge with a large real estate investment trust based in New York. But shareholders of the New York fund baulked and the deal collapsed.A few months later, JBG, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, had a new partner. In a deal valued at US$8.4 billion, JBG merged with a Washington unit spun off from the real estate behemoth Vornado Realty Trust.The new company, JBG Smith, with Mr Kelly as chief executive, became the dominant landowner in a Northern Virginia region now being called National Landing, a dilapidated area that includes parts of Crystal City, Pentagon City and Potomac Yard. Amazon announced on Tuesday that it was choosing this area, along with New York City, for two new headquarters, with 50,000 employees between them.Since Amazon started its search for a so-called HQ2 more than a year ago, the Washington region has been considered a front-runner. The region gives the company access to a large, tech-savvy workforce and the transportation and infrastructure it wanted. Additionally, Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has a home in the area.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nFor Mr Kelly, Amazon's decision validated a plan that he had been selling for the better part of a year: revitalising Crystal City and its neighbours.\nMr Kelly's pitch was to turn a ghost town, as it has been described, into a thriving hot spot, including public green space and hip new retailers and entertainment venues. The plan relied on redeveloping 1970s-era office towers into sleek residential buildings.\nSceptical investors have become believers, sending shares of JBG Smith up 7 per cent in the past month.\nAnalysts warn that Amazon most likely flexed its muscles to negotiate a deal with highly favourable terms, possibly pushing for below-market leases in an area that already trends well below national and Washington averages.\nFor JBG Smith, the HQ2 deal may pay off in an uptick in occupancy and rents for residential, retail and other properties it owns adjacent to Amazon's new offices. But it could take five to seven years for this bonanza to arrive, said Danny Ismail, an analyst and lead of office coverage for the real estate research firm Green Street Advisors.\n\"This isn't going to be an overnight thing,\" Mr Ismail said.\nAmazon said it intended to lease 500,000 square feet of office space in three buildings owned by JBG Smith. Amazon has also agreed to buy numerous plots of land held by JBG Smith that could be developed for an extra 4.1 million square feet. The purchase price of the land and other terms were not disclosed.\nJBG Smith officials did not respond to requests for comment. But in the announcement on Tuesday, the firm said it planned to accelerate construction on other projects in the area, including developments that would create more office and retail space as well as hundreds of residential units.\nAmazon's move is a chance for JBG Smith to turn lemons into lemonade.\nFor the past year, JBG Smith's publicly traded real estate investment trust has trailed its peers, largely because of Crystal City and adjoining areas, which make up about a third of JBG Smith's portfolio.\nCharles E Smith Commercial Realty developed Crystal City in the 1960s and 1970s, and Vornado acquired that company in 2002.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "[NEW YORK] Around 100 people on Wednesday protested against Amazon's impending arrival in New York's borough of Queens, condemning US$3 billion in tax breaks and incentives, and worried ordinary families will be pushed out by gentrification.The online retail giant announced on Tuesday that it had selected Long Island City and Crystal City, just outside Washington, for two new headquarters that will each hire 25,000 people.While New York's Democratic state governor and mayor are delighted, critics fear it will accelerate gentrification in a city where affordable housing is increasingly rare and have questioned the size of the tax breaks offered to a company headed by the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos.According to New York officials the combined incentives offered for the Queens site total nearly US$3 billion, including both direct grants and tax breaks and commitments to improvements related to the project. In Virginia, the package reaches some US$2.5 billion according to The Wall Street Journal.\"I am steaming mad,\" elected Democrat councillor Jimmy Van Bramer told the rally near the prospective Amazon site on the East River overlooking Manhattan.\n\n\n SEE ALSO:  Protests as lesbian conference kicks off in Ukraine  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"We at the city council are going to be looking at every aspect of this,\" he said. \"We are going to see how we can reengage in a process that we were deliberately excluded from.\"\nNew York state senator Mike Gianaris also complained about \"secrecy\" behind the deal, vowed that opponents would \"go to court if we have to\" to renegotiate the agreement and demanded a consumer boycott of Amazon.\nAngela Tamura, a 47-year-old freelance artist who lives in nearby Jackson Heights, said she was \"very scared\" that Queens will no longer be \"affordable\" but was skeptical about demands for a boycott.\n\"They have worked themselves into our lives so deeply it's very hard to let go of Amazon,\" she said.\nShawn Dixon, 35, who works at a nearby barber shop, demanded that the city and the governor change the terms of the agreement with Amazon and protect small businesses to stop them being pushed out by rising rents.\n\"I dont know what can happen but that's why we are here today, to properly put pressure on him (Governor Andrew Cuomo) to change it,\" Mr Dixon said.\nAFP\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"We at the city council are going to be looking at every aspect of this,\" he said. \"We are going to see how we can reengage in a process that we were deliberately excluded from.\"\nNew York state senator Mike Gianaris also complained about \"secrecy\" behind the deal, vowed that opponents would \"go to court if we have to\" to renegotiate the agreement and demanded a consumer boycott of Amazon.\nAngela Tamura, a 47-year-old freelance artist who lives in nearby Jackson Heights, said she was \"very scared\" that Queens will no longer be \"affordable\" but was skeptical about demands for a boycott.\n\"They have worked themselves into our lives so deeply it's very hard to let go of Amazon,\" she said.\nShawn Dixon, 35, who works at a nearby barber shop, demanded that the city and the governor change the terms of the agreement with Amazon and protect small businesses to stop them being pushed out by rising rents.\n\"I dont know what can happen but that's why we are here today, to properly put pressure on him (Governor Andrew Cuomo) to change it,\" Mr Dixon said.\nAFP\n\"We at the city council are going to be looking at every aspect of this,\" he said. \"We are going to see how we can reengage in a process that we were deliberately excluded from.\"New York state senator Mike Gianaris also complained about \"secrecy\" behind the deal, vowed that opponents would \"go to court if we have to\" to renegotiate the agreement and demanded a consumer boycott of Amazon.Angela Tamura, a 47-year-old freelance artist who lives in nearby Jackson Heights, said she was \"very scared\" that Queens will no longer be \"affordable\" but was skeptical about demands for a boycott.\"They have worked themselves into our lives so deeply it's very hard to let go of Amazon,\" she said.Shawn Dixon, 35, who works at a nearby barber shop, demanded that the city and the governor change the terms of the agreement with Amazon and protect small businesses to stop them being pushed out by rising rents.\"I dont know what can happen but that's why we are here today, to properly put pressure on him (Governor Andrew Cuomo) to change it,\" Mr Dixon said.AFPSPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD. REGN NO. 198402668E", "ZurichIN AN industrial park outside Cologne, German grocer Rewe Group is fighting back against Amazon.com Inc with what it describes as the most technologically sophisticated online shopping facility in Europe.The closely held retailer's building, the size of two-and-a-half soccer fields, holds 20,000 items from drinks to diapers, twice as many as a typical supermarket. Products are stored in half a dozen distinct cooling zones. Orders are assembled with the help of a towering labyrinth of carriages, elevators and conveyors synchronised by the company's algorithms, before they are loaded on trucks and shipped out across a roughly 1,000-square-mile region from the Dutch border to Dusseldorf.All that tech - which contrasts with Amazon's largely human-operated grocery warehouses - is needed because of the country's strict laws on handling fresh food. For example, ground meat must be stored at no more than two degrees Celsius, apples and grapes at no more than seven degrees, and bananas and avocados at no more than 14 degrees.The complexity of those rules is one reason why online grocery sales have yet to take off in Germany. Now Rewe sees an opportunity to beat Amazon and other online retailers, like the UK's Ocado Group Plc, at their own game.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Europe's risk of paralysis in slowdown puts Germany on the spot  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"We need six different cooling zones, while Ocado in England can make do with three, making the complexity of our supply chain brutal,\" said Wolf-Axel Schultz, who runs the project. \"Brutal, but fascinating.\"\nRewe takes a high-tech approach at its Cologne site.

The latest entrant comes from a nation not known for state-of-the-art retail experiences: Israel.Shufersal Ltd, Israel's largest supermarket chain, is partnering local startup Trigo Vision Ltd to eliminate the need for cashiers in its 272 stores, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. Trigo's platform uses a feed from ceiling cameras to identify items in a customer's shopping cart, which are tallied to produce the bill.It's surprising Israel would be among the first countries to say farewell to the supermarket checkout line, as its startups traditionally pay little attention to the domestic market. Israeli tech entrepreneurs generally aim for clients in bigger markets, and many consumer-facing industries here lag behind technologies used in other developed economies.\"In providing pure commerce technology, I'm not sure Israel has a lot to offer,\" said Danny Peled, managing partner at Israeli venture capital firm KDC Media Fund. \"The local industry is not really developed, and you need a size and a magnitude to create the kinds of products that are world-beaters.\" Shufersal is trying to make supermarket shopping one of the few exceptions. According to the company, online sales account for 14 per cent of its roughly 12 billion shekels (S$4.6 billion) of annual revenue, which it says is one of the highest levels for major chains worldwide. E-commerce will account for about 2.5 per cent of the US$1 trillion US food and beverage market this year, according to Coresight Research.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nTechnology plays \"a big role\" in customer satisfaction, Shufersal's chief executive officer Itzik Abercohen said in the statement.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "New YorkLONG Island City was preparing for its breakneck development to pick up speed even before news that Amazon may move in. Earlier this year, much of the neighborhood was designated as an \"opportunity zone\", a classification that comes with a suite of generous tax benefits for real estate developers.If Amazon selects the neighbourhood for a major new North American campus, as is widely expected, it'll bring thousands of new, highly paid employees to the area and create a unique and irresistible combination for New York City builders. \"We've been seeing so much activity in Long Island City,\" said Jessica Millett, co-chair of the tax department at Duval & Stachenfeld, a law firm. \"The opportunity-zone activity ramps it up a level. Amazon threw fuel on that fire - my phone started exploding.\"At the centre of both decisions is New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who joked with reporters on Monday he'd even change his name to \"Amazon Cuomo\" to win over the internet giant.Mr Cuomo's administration, expected to grant the company a bevy of concessions to open an office hub there, was also charged with picking New York's opportunity zones.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Bezos upbeat on Amazon Go physical stores  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nThe incentives were a little-known provision of the Republican tax overhaul that US President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. Since then, they've captured the attention of developers and government officials because they have the potential to make projects in long-neglected areas more enticing.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated that US$100 billion may eventually flow to the roughly 8,700 struggling communities scattered around the country that were selected by state governors and officials in US territories.\nEven so, many of the zones are in urban areas that are already experiencing rapid development. That raises the risk that they will increase profits for projects that real estate investors would have undertaken anyway and end up displacing existing residents.\nInvestors start by ploughing capital gains from the sale of a business, stock or other asset into funds that target opportunity zones, deferring taxes until 2026 - and potentially reducing their liabilities by as much as 15 per cent. If the funds buy and hold qualifying businesses or property in opportunity zones for at least a decade, investors can avoid paying capital gains altogether on any of the appreciation.\nReal estate developers are looking for high-growth areas where they can reap the largest rewards from these incentives. To qualify, they need to significantly improve the property they purchase. While rules are still being finalised by the federal government, many types of new development - from towering residential towers to new office and retail space - are expected to qualify.\nLong Island City, once a decrepit post-industrial neighbourhood, has seen billions in investment in recent years, driven in part by its proximity to Manhattan. Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced another US$180 million to improve the neighbourhood's infrastructure, including sewer upgrades and a new school.\nIt isn't yet clear exactly where Amazon would situate its offices in the neighbourhood, or if it would be able to take advantage of the tax breaks. But developers that build or renovate real estate for Amazon could potentially use the breaks, in addition to whatever deal-sweeteners offered by Mr Cuomo to woo the tech giant. Either way, its decision will boost interest in the area.\nAlready, political opposition to Amazon's potential move is mounting, with calls to extract concessions from the tech giant and even levy a \"gentrification\" tax.\nJimmy Van Bramer, a city council member who represents the area, said that not all his constituents are excited about the prospect. \"We need to know what Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio have promised Amazon, and what Amazon has offered the city in return,\" he said.\nFor Long Island City developers and brokers concerned about the abundance of planned apartments, Amazon's an answer to their prayers.\nAlmost 1,700 units were proposed and more than 4,500 were already under construction in the neighbourhood, according to an April report by the Long Island City Partnership, an economic development group.\nDevelopers will want to act fast, though. The combination of tax breaks and a major new corporate campus could quickly drive up the cost of land and commercial real estate in the area, said Rob Wrzosek, a managing director at Berkadia, a mortgage lender backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Jefferies Financial Group.

The company once synonymous with mainframe computing has been slow to adopt cloud-related technologies and has had to play catch-up to market leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in offering computing and other software and services over the Internet.\"The acquisition of Red Hat is a game-changer. It changes everything about the cloud market,\" said Ginni Rometty, chairperson and chief executive officer of IBM, in a statement on Sunday.IBM has seen revenue decline by almost a quarter since Ms Rometty, 61, took the CEO role in 2012. While some of that has been from divestitures, most is from declining sales in existing hardware, software and services offerings, as the company has struggled to compete with younger technology companies. She has been trying to steer IBM toward more modern businesses, such as the cloud, artificial intelligence and security software with inconsistent results.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Massive CIA cloud deal could be fulfilled by more than one company  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings report, IBM disappointed investors who were seeking more progress in those areas after six years of declining sales that had only recently started to show gains. Still, the improvements had been coming largely from IBM's legacy mainframe business, rather than its so-called strategic imperatives. Cloud revenue grew 10 per cent in the period to US$4.5 billion, but that was slower than the 20 per cent expansion in the second quarter.\nThe Red Hat deal could signal to investors that IBM wasn't as well positioned in cloud as it had been claiming, said Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup Research.\n\"We expect investor scepticism around the deal given IBM's messaging that it is well underway in its transformation,\" he noted.\nInvestors have grown impatient. The stock is down 19 per cent this year and 31 per cent over the last five years, giving IBM a market value of US$114 billion.\nWarren Buffett virtually gave up on IBM last year. His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, cut its stake in the company by 94 per cent, while increasing its investment in Apple Inc.\nThe Red Hat deal represents an admission by Ms Rometty that in-house growth wasn't going to be enough to keep IBM from falling permanently behind in a market that is growing in importance and size.\nAcquiring Red Hat makes IBM \"a credible player in cloud now,\" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana said. \"This gives them an asset that looks forward and not backwards.\"\nIBM will pay US$190 a share in cash for Raleigh, North Carolina-based Red Hat, according to a statement from the companies on Sunday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. That's a 63 per cent premium over Red Hat's closing price of US$116.68 per share on Friday.\nMs Rometty said IBM \"paid a very fair price. This is a premium company. If you look underneath, this is strong revenue growth, strong profit strong free cash flow,\" she added.\nRevenue at Red Hat, which sells software and services based on the open-source Linux operating system, is expected to top US$3 billion for the first time this year as the company's Red Hat Enterprise Linux product attracts business from large customers.\nLast quarter the company reported a record 11 contracts valued at over US$5 million each and 73 over US$1 million, according to a note from JMP Securities analyst Greg McDowell.\nAt the same time, sales last quarter overall missed analysts' expectations and the forecast for the current quarter also fell short, fuelling concerns Red Hat may be losing deals to rivals and growth may be slowing. The company said at the time it believes the slowdown has \"bottomed out\".\nRed Hat's stock is down 28 per cent over the past six months through Friday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nArmonk, New York-based IBM will continue to grow its dividend and neither company will cut jobs after the deal, Ms Rometty said. \"This is an acquisition for revenue growth, this is not for cost synergies,\" she added.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Lazard Ltd advised IBM on the deal. Morgan Stanley and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Red Hat, while Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom provided legal advice.\n\"Knowing first-hand how important open, hybrid cloud technologies are to helping businesses unlock value, we see the power of bringing these two companies together,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in an emailed statement.

When the headphones are paired to a phone with the Alexa app on it, users will be able to talk to the voice assistant by tapping a button on the headphones.The functionality would be similar to Apple Inc's AirPods wireless earbuds, which enable users can tap the devices to talk to Apple's virtual assistant, Siri.Amazon and Alphabet Inc's Google, whose voice assistants have most often been found in their respective smart speakers for the home, are rushing to partner with headphone makers.Models from Bose Corp and Jabra feature Alexa built in, and Sony Corp said earlier this year that a software update will make some of its headphone models work with Alexa.
