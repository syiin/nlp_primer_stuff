The company once synonymous with mainframe computing has been slow to adopt cloud-related technologies and has had to play catch-up to market leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in offering computing and other software and services over the Internet.\"The acquisition of Red Hat is a game-changer. It changes everything about the cloud market,\" said Ginni Rometty, chairperson and chief executive officer of IBM, in a statement on Sunday.IBM has seen revenue decline by almost a quarter since Ms Rometty, 61, took the CEO role in 2012. While some of that has been from divestitures, most is from declining sales in existing hardware, software and services offerings, as the company has struggled to compete with younger technology companies.

Analysts estimated US$19.9 billion. Profit, excluding some items, was US$3.08 a share, compared with analysts' projections of US$3.04 a share.Still, profit margins are stagnating and the Armonk, New York-based company saw a slight sales decline in the unit that includes its Watson artificial intelligence business. Shares gained about 2 per cent in early trading Thursday after closing at US$144.52 in New York.While revenue has declined for most of the past five years, IBM has been asking investors to focus on what it calls strategic imperatives - a collection of newer businesses like cloud computing, AI and security software. The cloud business grew 18 per cent, adjusting for currency changes, to US$4.7 billion in the quarter. That's an improvement from the disappointing 14 per cent IBM posted earlier this year.

At an IBM office in downtown San Francisco, Noa Ovadia, a college senior who won an Israeli championship in 2016, squared off with IBM's program, called the IBM Debater. She argued against government subsidies for space exploration.The machine argued in favour, delivering three brief speeches in a digitally created monotone and - at least in small ways - responding to Ms Ovadia's human opinions. \"Another point that I believe my opponent made is that there are more important things than space exploration to spend money on,\" the machine said during its lengthy rebuttal. \"It is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I dispute this. No one is claiming that this is the only item on our expense list.\"Under development for six years, this artificial intelligence system is part of a broader effort to build technology that can interact with people the way we interact with one another. Last month, Google demonstrated a system, called Google Duplex, that can phone a restaurant and make dinner reservations. In China, you can phone Xiaoice, a \"chatbot\" built by Microsoft, and spend a few minutes shooting the breeze. Companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have for several years offered coffee table gadgets and smartphone apps that answer simple questions or perform simple tasks. (\"Hey, Siri. Set my alarm for 7 am tomorrow.\")\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nProjects like IBM Debater and Google Duplex show that this kind of system is starting to stretch beyond simple commands. But they also demonstrate the limitations of current technology. IBM's system was designed to debate about 100 topics, but these interactions are tightly constrained: a four-minute opening statement followed by a rebuttal to its opponent's argument - and then a statement summing up its own viewpoint. It was not exactly Lincoln v Douglas.\nSubsidised space exploration, the machine said during its opening statement, \"inspires our children to pursue education and careers in science and technology and mathematics.\" \"It is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care,\" it added. Noam Slonim, an IBM researcher who helped oversee the project, estimated that the technology could have a \"meaningful\" debate on those 100 topics 40 per cent of the time. IBM chose the topic for the live debate before it began. In some cases, the machine's lengthy speeches hinted at how it was stitching together its arguments - identifying relevant sentences and clauses and then combining them into a reasonably coherent, computerised thought.\nGoogle Duplex is also limited to narrow tasks. (It can \"schedule hair salon appointments\" or \"get holiday hours\" as well as book restaurant reservations.) And because Google has revealed the system only in brief demonstrations, it is unclear how well it really performs. Certainly, systems like Xiaoice are a long way from passing the Turing Test, the challenge laid down by the British computing pioneer Alan Turing in the 1950s that asks whether a machine can play \"the imitation game\" to mimic humans.\nNo one would mistake these systems for a human - at least not after a lengthy conversation. In 2011, IBM demonstrated a system that could beat the leading players at the trivia game show \"Jeopardy!\" The company used this system, called Watson, as a way of promoting a wide range of products and consulting services for hospitals and other businesses.

Another will generate the text of the argument. And so on. Typically, each system is designed and built independently, before researchers meld them together.

But understanding language is far more complex. That means systems that perform fairly simple language tasks - like writing a Wikipedia article, let alone engaging in a serious debate on a random topic - may still be years away. \"It is now very obvious this change is happening,\" said Jeremy Howard, an independent researcher working in this area. \"But these things take time.\" NYTIMES\n\nProjects like IBM Debater and Google Duplex show that this kind of system is starting to stretch beyond simple commands. But they also demonstrate the limitations of current technology. IBM's system was designed to debate about 100 topics, but these interactions are tightly constrained: a four-minute opening statement followed by a rebuttal to its opponent's argument - and then a statement summing up its own viewpoint. It was not exactly Lincoln v Douglas.Subsidised space exploration, the machine said during its opening statement, \"inspires our children to pursue education and careers in science and technology and mathematics.\" \"It is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care,\" it added. Noam Slonim, an IBM researcher who helped oversee the project, estimated that the technology could have a \"meaningful\" debate on those 100 topics 40 per cent of the time. IBM chose the topic for the live debate before it began. In some cases, the machine's lengthy speeches hinted at how it was stitching together its arguments - identifying relevant sentences and clauses and then combining them into a reasonably coherent, computerised thought.Google Duplex is also limited to narrow tasks. (It can \"schedule hair salon appointments\" or \"get holiday hours\" as well as book restaurant reservations.) And because Google has revealed the system only in brief demonstrations, it is unclear how well it really performs. Certainly, systems like Xiaoice are a long way from passing the Turing Test, the challenge laid down by the British computing pioneer Alan Turing in the 1950s that asks whether a machine can play \"the imitation game\" to mimic humans.No one would mistake these systems for a human - at least not after a lengthy conversation. In 2011, IBM demonstrated a system that could beat the leading players at the trivia game show \"Jeopardy!\" The company used this system, called Watson, as a way of promoting a wide range of products and consulting services for hospitals and other businesses. After Watson won, Slonim, a researcher at an IBM lab in Haifa, Israel, pitched the Debater project as IBM's next \"grand challenge.\" The long-running project is in some ways an unorthodox addition to the rapidly accelerating field of artificial intelligence research.

The length of hospital stays, medical histories, surgical procedures, and other contributing factors are then taken into consideration by the system before it makes claims recommendations and calculates the payouts to policyholders.Andrew Yeo, Income's general manager for life and health insurance, noted that the move is significant especially as the insurer expects claims volume to rise amid Singapore's growing silver population.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: NTUC Income, China's ZA Tech team up to develop digital insurance products  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"By automating the most tedious aspect of the claims process, Income is better placed to scale our responsiveness to higher volume of claims and to provide our policyholders with a favourable claims experience as we continue to enhance our efficiency and accuracy in claims assessment, review and approval.\"\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\"By automating the most tedious aspect of the claims process, Income is better placed to scale our responsiveness to higher volume of claims and to provide our policyholders with a favourable claims experience as we continue to enhance our efficiency and accuracy in claims assessment, review and approval.\"\n\"By automating the most tedious aspect of the claims process, Income is better placed to scale our responsiveness to higher volume of claims and to provide our policyholders with a favourable claims experience as we continue to enhance our efficiency and accuracy in claims assessment, review and approval.\"SPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

He has since claimed credit for preventing thousands of manufacturing jobs from moving overseas and used state incentives to strike a deal with Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp, to pull back on its plans to move some operations to Mexico.Ms Rometty is continuing what is emerging as a formula among technology companies: in conjunction with meetings with Trump in his Manhattan tower, pledge to create jobs and invest billions of dollars in the US, even if the plans had already been in the works since before he was elected. The advantage for companies is that it can deflect criticism from the new administration that the industry is shifting jobs offshore, while also giving Mr Trump a way to take credit for job creation goals that may have little to do with his election.IBM said in March it had more than 25,000 positions open globally and that it had started to cut some jobs in the US as part of a \"workforce rebalancing\" in an effort to add staff with cloud and other specific skills.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Massive CIA cloud deal could be fulfilled by more than one company  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nOver the past few years, IBM - like many large US-based companies - has been criticized for eliminating thousands of jobs in the country and moving resources to places such as India.
