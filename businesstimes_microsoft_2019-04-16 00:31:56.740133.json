The company said it had found that hackers targeted more than 100 e-mail accounts at think tanks and nongovernmental organisations that work on issues including election security, nuclear policy and foreign relations.Microsoft did not address what country the attacks came from, but it blamed a group of hackers sometimes called Fancy Bear. Online security companies have identified Fancy Bear as a Russian group, and it is widely believed to be tied to Russian intelligence.Fancy Bear was involved in the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee in the United States, according to the party and security researchers.

Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft who helped usher in the personal computing revolution and then channelled his enormous fortune into transforming Seattle into a cultural destination, died Monday in Seattle. He was 65.The cause was complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, his family said in a statement.The disease recurred recently, after having been in remission for years. He left Microsoft in 1982, when the cancer first appeared.He was a force at the company during its first seven years, along with his co-founder, Bill Gates, as the personal computer was moving from a hobbyist curiosity to a mainstream technology, used by both businesses and consumers.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Microsoft's work with Chinese military university triggers concerns  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nWhen the company was founded in 1975, the machines were known as microcomputers, to contrast the desktop computers with the hulking room-size machines of the day.\nMr Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, a company that made software for small computers. The term personal computer (PC) would become commonplace later.\nThe company's first product was a much-compressed version of the Basic programming language, designed to work on the underpowered machines.\nYet the company's big move came when it promised IBM that it would deliver the operating system software for the computer giant's entry into the PC business. Mr Gates and Mr Allen committed to supplying that software in 1980, but it was then a promise without a product.\nMr Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. The Microsoft founders tweaked the code, and it became the operating system that guided the operations of the IBM personal computer, which was introduced in 1981.\nThat product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company.

US officials have repeatedly warned that the November vote is a major focus for interference efforts. Microsoft said the sites were created over the past several months but did not go into more specifics.Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit took the lead role in finding and disabling the sites, and the company is launching an effort to provide expanded cybersecurity protection for campaigns and election agencies that use Microsoft products.Among those targeted were the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington, DC, think tank active in investigations of corruption in Russia, and the International Republican Institute (IRI), a non-profit group that promotes democracy worldwide.

Facebook recently disclosed that the company had taken down 32 fake accounts and pages that were tied to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian disinformation operation active before and after the 2016 election.\nAfter discovering the sites recently, Microsoft said, it sought to obtain a court order to transfer the domain names to its own servers, a legal tactic that the company's security division has used a dozen times since 2016 to disable 84 websites created by APT28, which also is sometimes called Strontium or Fancy Bear. APT28, a unit under the Russian military intelligence agency GRU, specialises in information warfare or hacking and disinformation operations. \"APT\" refers to \"advanced persistent threat\" in cybersecurity circles.\nThe court order, executed last week, effectively allowed Microsoft to shut down the sites and to research them more fully.

It sits near an existing Amazon technical centre and customer support operation.Amazon did not offer details about the new building in Cape Town, or what its function might be.\"As more South African customers and partners continue to choose AWS as their cloud provider, we continue to hire more staff into our offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg,\" Geoff Brown, AWS' Sub-Saharan Africa regional manager, told Reuters in a statement.In another sign of Amazon's cloud-computing drive in South Africa, it is offering startups free cloud trials for one year, according to local entrepreneur Tumi Menyatswe - a deal that prompted her to switch to AWS from Google's cloud.\"This allows me to focus on my business and to grow until I can pay them,\" said Ms Menyatswe, CEO of two-year-old business Minderz, which pairs pet owners with people able to look after cats and dogs during holidays.It is difficult to measure the relative success of the big cloud-computing players in Africa as they do not break out financial results for the continent. However, according to analysts, data centres are one measure of growth.Despite its history on the continent, Amazon has yet to build a data centre in Africa. Microsoft, by contrast, announced last year that it was building two data centres in South Africa, one in Cape Town and one in Johannesburg, both due to launch later this year.Microsoft said in a statement that the plans were on track but would not specify when the data centres would be launched in 2018.Local data centres offer advantages, in part by reducing \"latency\", or delays, in data transmission. \"Closer is almost always better,\" said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research.Clifford De Wit, former chief innovation officer at Microsoft South Africa, said that a local data centre was a big advantage. \"Having the actual data centre close has so many implications,\" said Mr De Wit, now chief technology officer at startup Dexterity Digital. He cited privacy regulations that require banks and some other companies to store data locally, among other benefits.Amazon's Mr Brown told Reuters that South Africa was \"one of the many possibilities that we are currently looking at\" globally for opening a new data centre. He said that the company launched new \"Edge\" locations - infrastructure that boosts transmission speeds from primary data centres outside the continent - in Johannesburg and Cape Town in the past two months. This will reduce latency for South African customers and bring other benefits, he said. REUTERSSPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

At US$399, the device is US$400 cheaper than the current Surface Pro tablet, but has slower Intel Corp processors and about four hours less battery time, Microsoft said. The new tablet weighs 522 grams, far lighter than existing Surface products. It goes on sale on Aug 2 with Wi-Fi connectivity. Cellular versions are coming later.Like Microsoft's earlier devices, the Surface Go will work with optional keyboards and mouses. The company announced cheaper versions of both accessories on Monday. For the first time on Microsoft hardware, the Go will use the USB-C charging standard. The new tablets come in multiple configurations, including 64, 128, and 256 gigabyte storage options and 4 or 8 gigabytes of RAM. Prices range from US$399 to more than US$549. The sub-US$400 price point is key for Microsoft as it tries to turn its Surface business into a more serious challenger to other computer hardware makers.Cheaper devices can attract students who get comfortable with the technology and spread it to the workplace after they graduate. That strategy has helped Apple, which unveiled a US$299 iPad earlier this year for schools. Google has also seen some success with its low-cost Chromebook laptops. The Surface Go is still more expensive than the cheapest iPad, but the Go tablet is compatible with professional features, like the detachable keyboard, that are missing on the entry-level iPad. Microsoft released a US$499 Surface 3 tablet in 2015, but discontinued the product in 2016. The software giant kicked off its consumer hardware push in 2012 with the launch of the Surface RT. These tablets didn't resonate with consumers, so the company focused more on pricier Pro models.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Fed signals patience in 2019 amid mounting risks to growth  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nSo far, Microsoft has struggled to make a hit Surface product.

REGN NO. 198402668E"], "14 May 2018": ["WashingtonIT'S relatively easy these days to find critics of Skype, the popular online calling service that Microsoft acquired in 2011 for US$8.5 billion.Former devotees routinely gripe on social media that the software has become too difficult to use. On the Apple App store and Google Play store, negative reviews of the smartphone app are piling up, citing everything from poor call quality to gluttonous battery demand.In March, tech investor and commentator Om Malik summarised the negativity by tweeting that Skype was \"a turd of the highest quality\" and directing his ire at its owner. \"Way to ruin Skype and its experience. I was forced to use it today, but never again.\"Microsoft says the criticism is overblown and reflects, in part, people's grumpiness with software updates. There are also other factors undermining users' affection for an Internet tool that 15 years ago introduced the idea of making calls online, radically resetting the telecommunications landscape in the process.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Microsoft's work with Chinese military university triggers concerns  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\nSince acquiring Skype from private equity investors, Microsoft has refocused the online calling service on the corporate market, a change that has made Skype less intuitive and harder to use, prompting many Skypers to defect to similar services operated by Apple, Google, Facebook and Snap.\nThe company hasn't updated the number of Skype users since 2016, when it put the total at 300 million.\nBy turning Skype into a key part of its lucrative Office suite for corporate customers, Microsoft is threatening what made it appealing to regular folks in the first place.\nFounded in 2003 by a pair of Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype freed tens of millions of people from the tyranny of the phone companies by offering cheap overseas calls.\nThe company has cycled through various owners, including EBay. By 2011, the company was controlled by a Silver Lake-led consortium of investors and shopping itself to potential acquirers including Google and Microsoft even as it prepared for an initial public offering.\nKeen to reduce Microsoft's reliance on the personal computer, former CEO Steve Ballmer saw in Skype an internet brand that was so popular it had become a verb. He decided to buy the leading incumbent and pay a 40 per cent premium over what Skype valued itself at the time.\n\"It was the biggest asset in the space at the time with the most recognised brand,\" says Lori Wright, who joined the Skype team as general manager last year from video-conference rival BlueJeans. \"It was an opportunistic way for Microsoft to enter into something that was going to be significant.\"\nFocusing on corporations was a reasonable strategy and one shared by Skype's prior management. Originally Mr Ballmer and company pledged to let Skype operate independently from Lync, Microsoft's nascent internet phone service for corporations. But two years later the company began merging the two into Skype for Business and folded that into Office. Today, Microsoft is using Skype for Business to help sell subscriptions to its cloud-based Office 365 and steal customers from Cisco. Microsoft has essentially turned Skype into a replacement for a corporate telephone system - with a few modern features borrowed from instant messaging, artificial intelligence and social networking.\nTeams, the company's year-old version of Slack, is being merged with Skype for Business. LinkedIn, another acquisition, will provide work bios of the people Skypers are about to call. Drawing on Microsoft's pioneering work in AI, Skype can now translate calls into 12 languages.\nAs proof that the strategy is working, Microsoft points to a roster of blue-chip customers. Among them is General Electric, which says it rolled out Skype for Business to 220,000 employees late last year and is logging 5.5 million meeting minutes a day. Accenture and some of the largest banks are also big users, according to Office 365 marketing vice-president Ron Markezich. In a Forrester survey of 6,259 information workers, 28 per cent said that they used Skype for Business for conferencing, compared with 21 per cent for Cisco's products. Atkins, a UK engineering-design company that's part of SNC Lavalin Group, says its 18,500 workers use Skype for telephone service, conferences and sharing projects - to the tune of 10 million minutes a month.\nBut Microsoft has paid a price for prioritising corporations over consumers. The former seek robust security, search and the ability to host town halls; the latter ease-of-use and decent call quality.

REGN NO. 198402668E", "[SEATTLE] Facebook and Google are under the microscope for the ways their technologies can spread misinformation, while Amazon\u2019s growing market power is a regular target of US President Donald Trump. And Apple pioneered the modern smartphone, a device increasingly seen as too addicting.Then there is Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech\u2019s biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry\u2019s moral conscience.Among the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.On Monday, the conscientious side of Microsoft was on display again at Build, a three-day conference for developers in Seattle. Mr Nadella announced a programme, AI for Accessibility, that will award US$25 million over five years to researchers, non-profits and developers who use artificial intelligence to help people with disabilities. Mr Nadella, whose adult son was born with cerebral palsy, has written about how his son\u2019s disability helped make him more empathetic.Echoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Microsoft's work with Chinese military university triggers concerns  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company is not a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can.\nBut while the company\u2019s power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalisation of US$733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook.\n\u201cThe irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThis has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology.\u201d\nSince taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era.\nTwo decades ago, Microsoft was depicted as a bully that ran roughshod over competitors in a landmark antitrust suit brought by the US government, followed by similar cases brought by the European Union and private companies. Smith was brought in to make peace in Microsoft\u2019s antitrust battles, and Mr Nadella was the company\u2019s first chief executive to start in the job since those suits were settled.\nIn a phone interview, Mr Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.\nThis year, Microsoft published a book that outlined some of the harmful effects that could come from artificial intelligence, such as bias in job recruiting. It has litigated four lawsuits against the U.S. government during the past five years in efforts to defend customers\u2019 privacy rights. One of them, a fight over law enforcement access to data stored in an overseas Microsoft data center, went to the US Supreme Court, which dropped the case after Congress enacted a law that mooted it.\n\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organiser. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201d\nThe closest analog among Mr Nadella\u2019s peers is Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who has painted Apple as a staunch defender of its customers\u2019 privacy. He has jabbed at Facebook and Google, both advertising-supported businesses that profit from the personal data they collect from their users, a contrast to Apple\u2019s business model of selling devices.\nFacebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They have promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.\nMr Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in Internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.\nMr Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr Cook to publicly criticise other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World\u201d.\nHis lieutenant, Mr Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.\nMicrosoft is still occasionally cast in the role of villain. A California man who sold recycled electronic waste recently pleaded guilty for creating thousands of unauthorised discs that helped people restore the Windows operating system on refurbished PCs. The recycler, who has been sentenced to 15 months in prison, has said Microsoft supported the case against him, which was brought by US prosecutors, because he threatened part of its business. Microsoft published a long blog post that portrayed his actions unfavourably.\nStill, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\n\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.\nMr Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\n\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201d\nNYTIMES\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company is not a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech.

Smith was brought in to make peace in Microsoft\u2019s antitrust battles, and Mr Nadella was the company\u2019s first chief executive to start in the job since those suits were settled.In a phone interview, Mr Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.This year, Microsoft published a book that outlined some of the harmful effects that could come from artificial intelligence, such as bias in job recruiting. It has litigated four lawsuits against the U.S. government during the past five years in efforts to defend customers\u2019 privacy rights. One of them, a fight over law enforcement access to data stored in an overseas Microsoft data center, went to the US Supreme Court, which dropped the case after Congress enacted a law that mooted it.\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organiser. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201dThe closest analog among Mr Nadella\u2019s peers is Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who has painted Apple as a staunch defender of its customers\u2019 privacy. He has jabbed at Facebook and Google, both advertising-supported businesses that profit from the personal data they collect from their users, a contrast to Apple\u2019s business model of selling devices.Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They have promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.Mr Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in Internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.Mr Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr Cook to publicly criticise other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World\u201d.His lieutenant, Mr Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.Microsoft is still occasionally cast in the role of villain. A California man who sold recycled electronic waste recently pleaded guilty for creating thousands of unauthorised discs that helped people restore the Windows operating system on refurbished PCs. The recycler, who has been sentenced to 15 months in prison, has said Microsoft supported the case against him, which was brought by US prosecutors, because he threatened part of its business. Microsoft published a long blog post that portrayed his actions unfavourably.Still, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.Mr Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201dNYTIMESSPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

For energy sector clients, confirmation of payment within 60 days was required.\"If we do not receive from you documents confirming payment on orders from the defence and energy sectors, the order could be viewed by the vendor as not complying with the processing procedure and rejected,\" Merlion's notification said.RRC did not spell out the new restrictions in its notification, sent by email last month to its partners.\"In the event that you have buyers from the following sectors of the economy (financial, defence, energy) and they are in the sanctions list, you are requested IN ADVANCE to contact your RRC manager for further instructions.\" \"In connection with this, serious restrictions are being introduced on the placing of, and payment for, orders for Microsoft products ... placed by these buyers (and also their subsidiaries and affiliated companies),\" the notification said.Besides the tighter lending rules and other new restrictions, a change of wording in the US sanctions package is also sending ripples through the Russian economy.The previous wording was the US president \"may impose\" penalties if rules are violated. That has now changed to \"shall impose\" penalties, unless it is not in the national interest.Lawyers who advise clients on US sanctions compliance said this meant it was more likely Washington would impose penalties on foreign entities doing prohibited business with a company on the sanctions list.In response, companies are trying to put as much distance as possible between themselves and Russian entities on the US blacklist, fearing they could end up on it too by association, bankers, lawyers, officials, and business executives said.Some companies are conducting audits to find out if their partners deal with any sanctioned entities and are, in some cases, halting those relationships, according to a sanctions lawyer and an executive with a large industrial firm.\"Even Chinese companies started to ask,\" said a senior source close to the Kremlin and the Russian government, alluding to the fact some Chinese companies have until now continued to do deals even where many Western firms have pulled back.At the same time, companies that are on the sanctions list, or believe they may be added, are looking for intermediary firms that would allow their partners to keep working with them, albeit at arm's length.A person who works closely with a billionaire Russian oligarch said he assessed the risk the oligarch's business would be put under US sanctions was only 10 per cent. Even so, he said, the business was taking precautions so it can keep operating if Washington does blacklist it.\"We are establishing non-affiliated business units. Or deal with large local partners,\" said the source, who declined to be identified to avoid attracting attention to his boss's business.A Russian finance ministry source said he expected an uptick in the number of shell companies being set up as a mechanism to bypass the expanded sanctions.Two executives from two top-20 Russian banks said they viewed the fact their clients included Rosneft as a risk. One said many of the bank's clients had started to ask whether the Rosneft ties exposed the lender to sanctions risk.REUTERSSPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

Experts can't agree about whether it is backed by a national government, let alone which one.More than a week after stories about the breaches first appeared in 2013, Microsoft published a brief statement that portrayed its own break-in as limited and made no reference to the bug database.\"As reported by Facebook and Apple, Microsoft can confirm that we also recently experienced a similar security intrusion,\"the company said on Feb 22, 2013.\"We found a small number of computers, including some in our Mac business unit, that were infected by malicious software using techniques similar to those documented by other organisations. We have no evidence of customer data being affected, and our investigation is ongoing.\" Inside the company, alarm spread as officials realised the database for tracking patches had been compromised, according to the five former security employees. They said the database was poorly protected, with access possible via little more than a password.Concerns that hackers were using stolen bugs to conduct new attacks prompted Microsoft to compare the timing of those breaches with when the flaws had entered the database and when they were patched, according to the five former employees.These people said the study concluded that even though the bugs in the database were used in ensuing hacking attacks, the perpetrators could have gotten the information elsewhere.That finding helped justify Microsoft's decision not to disclose the breach, the former employees said, and in many cases patches already had been released to its customers.Three of the five former employees Reuters spoke with said the study could not rule out stolen bugs having been used in follow-on attacks.\"They absolutely discovered that bugs had been taken,\" said one. \"Whether or not those bugs were in use, I don't think they did a very thorough job of discovering.\" That's partly because Microsoft relied on automated reports from software crashes to tell when attacks started showing up. The problem with this approach, some security experts say, is that most sophisticated attacks do not cause crashes, and the most targeted machines - such as those with sensitive government information - are the least likely to allow automated reporting.REUTERSSPH Digital News\u00a9 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

Now, the company is waking up to the problem in its\u00a0own backyard, after the 2016 presidential election shed light on how far rural parts of America had fallen behind cities in reliable, fast connectivity - and the challenges that gap poses for residents.The software giant on Tuesday is calling for a national\u00a0strategy that eliminates the rural broadband gap over the next five years. It's starting by funding\u00a0projects to bring access to less-populated\u00a0areas in 12 US states in the next year, and will share the new technology with other companies that want to do the same.By 2022, the Redmond, Washington-based company plans to provide fast internet to 2 million people, using so-called white-spaces\u00a0spectrum - the\u00a0unused frequencies between TV channels. It will face some hurdles, including opposition\u00a0from broadcasters reluctant to surrender airwaves.Right now, 23.4\u00a0million Americans in rural areas can't get the fast internet access increasingly needed for tasks like homework, job applications, online medical treatment and remote repairs for farming equipment.\u00a0Over the years, Microsoft developed and tested its broadband software, along with new chips, devices and antennae,\u00a0in places including\u00a0Kenya and Colombia. While it has had some US projects, Microsoft\u00a0largely overlooked its home country in efforts to bridge the digital divide. That message was underscored in last year's\u00a0presidential election, when rural voters expressed dissatisfaction and anger over being left out of economic and technological growth, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said.\n\n\n SEE ALSO: Microsoft's work with Chinese military university triggers concerns  \n\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\u00a0\"It's fair to say the election raised our level of consciousness, as it did for a great many people in the country,\" Mr Smith\u00a0said in an interview.\n\"It certainly caused us to reflect on the fact that we had been pursuing these projects to a greater degree in rural Africa than rural America. We'd been involved in Asia and other continents more so than in our own country.\"\nUsing white-spaces spectrum is 80 per cent cheaper than a fiber connection and half the price of wireless, Mr Smith said.\u00a0\nA program that uses white-spaces technology for 80 per cent of rural America, with satellite and wireless for the rest, could end the broadband gap at a cost of US$10 billion, the company said.\nThat could be key because President Donald Trump has\u00a0pledged\u00a0to expand service to rural areas with a budget some policy wonks\u00a0say isn't sufficient to reach all the places\u00a0in the US that need it. Politicians have been talking about fixing the shortfall in rural access for years.\nRecently,\u00a0much of the spending on connectivity has added\u00a0capacity to areas already connected rather than\u00a0hooking up new ones, Mr Smith said. Some of the US$7.2 billion spent\u00a0on rural broadband in President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus\u00a0bill was wasted, said Representative Collin Peterson of\u00a0Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee.\u00a0\nAid went to more prosperous areas that may be more profitable\u00a0for providers but did little to expand access, he said recently.\nMr Smith, who is\u00a0from Appleton, Wisconsin, and other Microsoft officials have\u00a0been visiting small-town America\u00a0since November. They've met with students who\u00a0drive to library parking lots to piggyback off the Wi-Fi to turn in homework and veterans who are hours from VA clinics but could use telemedicine if only they had a decent internet connection.\nMicrosoft's initial projects will be in\u00a0Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington\u00a0and Wisconsin.\nSince the election, some tech\u00a0companies have been among those paying\u00a0closer attention to the fading of the American Dream for some parts of the country. In some cases, they've found technology made inequality\u00a0worse for those who can't access it. Facebook co-founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been travelling across the US, talking with truckers in Walcott, Iowa; dining with Somali refugees in Minneapolis; and cleaning fish and photographing eagles in rural Alaska.\n\"It's terrific that Mark has been doing what he's doing. One of the points he's making is a valuable one -\u00a0that one of the best ways to learn about a place is to go visit it,\" Microsoft's Mr Smith said.\n\"At the end of the day we will and should be judged by our deeds and not just our words. That's one of the reasons we have been so focused, not just on learning more, but on doing new things.\"\nOne of the biggest ways Microsoft thinks it can make a difference is by bringing speedier online service to these areas -\u00a0a programme it's calling the Rural Airband\u00a0Initiative -\u00a0and helping other companies\u00a0do the same. The effort also lets the company tap into a priority for the Trump administration, whose promise to\u00a0expand broadband service is part of a US$1 trillion nationwide infrastructure plan.\nMicrosoft has been trying out the system in Charlotte and Halifax counties, two rural regions in southern Virginia.\u00a0The company covers the costs of capital investments to start the service through local telecommunications companies, many of which are small, sometimes family-owned, and can't afford or risk the up-front investment.\nOnce up and running, the carrier will give Microsoft a share of the revenue. The software maker will plow\u00a0those funds into connecting a new region. Microsoft itself has no plan to enter the telecom market or to make money directly from this service, Mr Smith said. The company's philanthropy arm, working with\u00a0 the National 4-H Council, will provide digital-skills training to local residents. Smith declined to say how much Microsoft will spend on the overall plan.\n\u00a0Already Microsoft's efforts in Virginia are making a difference to people like Gwen Harris and her college-bound son Dylan, who just graduated from high school and concurrently earned an associate degree from a community college (through a special program at his school).\nThe family had a dial-up internet connection until switching to a pricey satellite hookup about four years ago. But the system was still too slow and unreliable to download the research Dylan needed for papers or to upload them to professors - once a critical paper\u00a0never made it to the instructor.\nAnd the multiple math videos he had to watch ate up the limited data available in their plan. About two years ago, Dylan came home from school with a flyer asking for volunteers to test Microsoft's project. It took a little time to iron out the kinks, said Gwen Harris, but over the past year it has been reliable and fast, making a big difference in Dylan's community college classes.\n\"I just think it's wonderful that broadband internet has reached rural America and that our kids can be competitive with the rest of the world,\" she said. Next\u00a0Dylan will attend Old Dominion University, where he plans to study computer science.\nMicrosoft's own investments will provide access to less than 10 per cent of the rural population currently without broadband, so the software maker is asking other companies and the government to get involved. Microsoft will share the technology\u00a0as well as related patents for free with\u00a0partners and rivals.\nFor the system to work, Microsoft says the Federal Communications Commission, the US agency that regulates airwaves,\u00a0needs to allow broader use of white-space spectrum around the nation.\nThe company is asking for three channels.\u00a0The proposal is just one among competing ideas for using airwave space that's being rearranged as the FCC squeezes TV broadcasters to make more room for wireless data.\nTelevision\u00a0companies are already on the defensive - Microsoft has said\u00a0its needs could be accommodated with little harm to broadcasters, yet\u00a0the National Association of Broadcasters called that assertion \"nonsense\".\nThe trade group, whose members include CBS Corp, NBC owner Comcast Corp, ABC owner Walt Disney Co and 21st Century Fox Inc, used a\u00a0July 5\u00a0blog - laden with movie puns and entitled \"2 Fast 2 Spurious\" - to deem Microsoft's requests \"yet another heist movie based on a con game that's too clever by half\".\nMr Smith will unveil the company's plans in a speech at the Willard Hotel in Washington, near\u00a0the White House. The location was chosen because in 1916, AT&T used the same venue to demonstrate its new long-distance phone service - the company called General John Pershing at an army base in El Paso, Texas, and a pair of parents dialed their kids in San Francisco to say goodnight.\nThe message then was that the new technology could connect the the entire country. Mr Smith expects greater access to broadband internet to do the same now.\u00a0\n\"Our fundamental message is we did this before.\u00a0We can do it again,\" he said.\nBLOOMBERG\n\n\n\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\n    });\n  \n\n\n\u00a0\"It's fair to say the election raised our level of consciousness, as it did for a great many people in the country,\" Mr Smith\u00a0said in an interview.\n\"It certainly caused us to reflect on the fact that we had been pursuing these projects to a greater degree in rural Africa than rural America.
