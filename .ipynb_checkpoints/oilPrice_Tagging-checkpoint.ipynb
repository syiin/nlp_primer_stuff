       " '12 Apr 2019': ['Menlo Park, CaliforniaFOR years, Facebook has built its algorithms to maximise engagement and clicks - a strategy that has helped the company garner 2.7 billion users across its family of apps, including Instagram and Messenger. But increasingly, it is willing to go up against the way its software is designed to combat the spread of harmful content.On Wednesday, the company announced a slew of new features and incremental product updates that counter the core engineering of its own systems by tweaking them to do more to reduce the spread of misinformation and sensational news - borderline content that the company won\\'t remove entirely but is taking a more active role in policing.For example, it will update its scrolling news feed algorithm by reviewing little-known websites whose articles get sudden surges of traffic on Facebook - a pattern that internal tests showed were a red flag for misinformation and clickbait.

       "  'IN a recent opinion article, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he agreed with the growing consensus that Facebook - and other social media companies - should be subject to more regulation. The article, published in four countries and three languages, was fated to be misunderstood from the start.His first suggestion was to create an independent body so users could appeal against Facebook\\'s moderation decisions. Over the past few years, Facebook has caught fire from all sides for its content moderation. Some say hate speech should be censored more aggressively. At the same time, the company has been accused of censoring conservative viewpoints. And for years, it has been roundly criticised for its puritanical ban on female nipples.But if Facebook had its way, the ultimate authority would no longer lie with Facebook - or Twitter or YouTube or other competitors. That job would fall to unspecified \"regulators\". \"Regulation could set baselines for what\\'s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum,\" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. For a company exhausted by a year of scandal, a regulatory scapegoat is just what the doctor ordered. If you don\\'t like what we do, why don\\'t you try it for a change?US legal experts were incredulous. Daphne Keller of the Stanford Center for Internet and Society accused Facebook of proposing an unconstitutional system, knowing it was impossible. In an initial statement, Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union said it was a violation of the First Amendment. The Electronic Frontier Foundation claimed it would violate the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Facebook\\'s head of public policy, Kevin Martin, explained that while Mr Zuckerberg\\'s reference to \"regulation\" might mean actual government intervention in France, Germany and Ireland, it meant only private sector self-regulation in the United States.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nThis kind of faux regulation is nothing new. Among the examples cited were FINRA, a nongovernmental financial industry \"regulator\"; the Motion Picture Association of America, which rates films; and the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rates video games. (After this clarification, the ACLU\\'s Wizner agreed that independent bodies like the MPAA are not unconstitutional).\\nBut none of these examples deal with directly regulating speech. Social media content moderation is a different beast entirely. Slapping a label on a video game isn\\'t the same as banning distribution of the video game.\\nFacebook avoided bringing up the Hays Code, the closest corollary to what they propose. The MPAA\\'s rating system is a pale shadow of Hollywood\\'s old Hays Code, the now-laughable list of rules that for years had on-screen husbands and wives sleeping in separate beds.\\nThe Code was developed voluntarily by the studios in hopes of avoiding government censorship. It zealously policed depictions of romance, crime, law enforcement and the clergy. When the Supreme Court held that motion pictures were protected by the First Amendment in 1952, enforcement of the code diminished.\\nFacebook\\'s proposal is a bow to public opinion. In 2018, a coalition of advocacy groups published the Santa Clara Principles - new baseline rules for how content moderation should work. The principles focus most heavily on the right to appeal against decisions - particularly in conjunction with \"new independent self-regulatory mechanisms\" created in collaboration with industry.\\nAll this sounds like what The Verge\\'s Casey Newton calls \"a Facebook Supreme Court\". It\\'s almost as if the Santa Clara Principles were developed by a room full of lawyers. Hammer, meet nail.\\nDue process would be much welcomed in a world where people believe simultaneously that Facebook takes down too little content or too much. But due process is costly, even after removing high-billing lawyers from the equation. Consider that the Supreme Court, with a budget of nearly US$90 million, receives 8,000 petitions a year - most of which are rejected. Meanwhile, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by an ex-Facebook moderator, \"moderators are asked to review more than 10 million potentially rule-breaking posts per week\". No wonder content moderation on the big platforms doesn\\'t so much resemble an unpleasant visit to the Department of Motor Vehicles as it does a re-enactment of the horror film The Purge. Due process is a luxury good.\\nWe\\'re not likely to see a Facebook Supreme Court - not an American one, in any event. The Hays Code died after the First Amendment was extended to movies; a Hays Code for the Internet will probably be dead on arrival.\\nIn a confused, fractured world, Facebook would be glad to stick to a single global standard. This is perhaps why Mr Zuckerberg offers full-throated praise of the European Union\\'s privacy standard, the General Data Protection Regulation, in his op-ed. The fracture of the Internet into different spheres of influence would be bad for his business, and to that end, the company would much rather impose European sensibilities on the US Internet than deal with multiple standards.\\nSo, while the US government has its hands tied behind its back by the Constitution, the French, the Germans and the Irish will set their own bar for online speech.

       "  'WashingtonFACEBOOK has come under fire for its speech policies from multiple players in multiple nations for manifold reasons - sometimes for taking down too much content, other times for not taking down enough. Now, Mark Zuckerberg is asking for someone to tell him what to do instead. That\\'s an understandable but potentially dangerous request.Some have interpreted Mr Zuckerberg\\'s calls for greater regulation of content moderation, along with comments from Facebook\\'s head of global affairs this past weekend, as requests for a worldwide standard-setting on speech. But any international rules would be formed in part by repressive regimes - putting the Internet\\'s future in the hands of autocrats. No one set of rules can work for all countries, and people\\'s ability to express themselves online should not become a geopolitical bargaining chip.More likely, Facebook and its peers will be regulated country by country. That is more reasonable, though there are risks there, too. Australia has proposed throwing executives in jail if they let violent videos linger on their sites. Germany fines companies for illegal hate speech. Britain is consideringvhefty fines for \"harmful content\". What \"harmful\" means is unclear - and that\\'s precisely the problem.It is one thing for US legislators to hold companies accountable for acting recklessly with regard to illegal content, such as incitements to violence, though that is the sort of regulation Mr Zuckerberg almost certainly does not want. Letting legislators tell tech companies to ban even some categories of legal speech, on the other hand, would almost certainly be a violation of the First Amendment in the United States. Elsewhere, it would be a serious threat to free speech.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nFacebook\\'s head of public policyvclarified that Mr Zuckerberg does not want the US government to set speech rules, even if other countries might. Instead, he wants a third-party industry group to take charge. The threat is lower, but it could still be a way for Facebook to duck responsibility for its outsize role in society.\\nThat is not the right way to go. Facebook already has rules. They\\'re called terms of service. The platform should own them, rather than ask someone else to.\\nThat will require rethinking what\\'s acceptable in response to tragedies such as the New Zealand shootings, and it will require working with academics, advocates and anyone else who has an interest in grooming the world\\'s information landscape. It will require transparency reports and appeals processes, like those Facebook is already refining.

A similar product for Google\\'s Android platform is planned for later this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they\\'re not authorized to share the information publicly.The brief video spots appear in response to search results on the shopping app, valuable space for advertisers since people searching for products on the app have a higher propensity to buy than those scrolling through Facebook or watching videos on Google\\'s YouTube.Amazon has emerged as a fast-growing challenger in the digital advertising market since it captures 50 per cent of all online sales in the US.

       " '20 Mar 2019': ['CRITICISM of big tech companies that track us across the Internet without our informed consent misses a bigger picture: There are hundreds of ad-tracking companies that do the same,\\xa0and regulators have been powerless to rein them in.A report by the Danish privacy consulting firm Cookiebot says that 112\\xa0ad-tracking companies collect information about visitors to government and public sector websites in European Union countries, even though\\xa0the websites are not ad-supported. Of these, 52 were found on French government sites; German taxpayer-funded sites were found to be the best protected, yet one-third of their pages still contained advertising trackers.If you don\\'t recall authorising\\xa0that activity, that\\'s because you didn\\'t. Even if you clicked on an \"I accept cookies\" pop-up, which probably didn\\'t explain properly what cookies you were accepting, it didn\\'t cover all of the trackers. Some\\xa0were smuggled in.\"Modern websites typically include multiple third party javascript technologies to power various functions, such as video players, social sharing widgets, web analytics, galleries and comments sections,\" Cookiebot wrote. \"These scripts can act as Trojan horses, opening backdoors to the website code through which ad tech companies can silently insert their trackers.\"Government websites are often built on the cheap\\xa0and include all kinds of third-party components. So not even the governments of EU member states comply with the union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires site administrators to make sure users consent to the collection of their data. If you visit a national health service website with questions\\xa0about whether you are HIV positive, pregnant\\xa0or sliding into alcoholism\\xa0there\\'s a good chance you\\'re being watched in order to be targeted with ads.

Those who don\\'t want it should be shown random or loosely targeted ads, just like in the pre-tracking days.This wouldn\\'t kill Facebook or Google,\\xa0which have huge audiences.

       " '16 Mar 2019': ['[WASHINGTON] The academic who helped Cambridge Analytica vacuum up private information from tens of millions of Facebook profiles sued the social media giant Friday, arguing that the company defamed him when it claimed he had lied about how the data was going to be used.Since the full scope of Cambridge Analytica\\'s data mining was revealed last year, Facebook has repeatedly tried to shift blame for the privacy breach onto the academic, Alexander Kogan. Facebook executives — including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg — have said Mr Kogan told Facebook that the data was for academic purposes when it was being collected for use in political campaigns.Mr Kogan, 32, a former psychology professor, used a quiz app to collect the data, and has insisted that the fine print accompanying his app said the information could be used commercially. That was an outright violation of Facebook\\'s rules at the time, but the company does not appear to have regularly checked that apps were complying.\"Alex did not lie, Alex was not a fraud, Alex did not deceive them, this was not a scam,\" said Steve Cohen, a lawyer for Mr Kogan. \"Facebook knew exactly what this app was doing, or should have known. Facebook desperately needed a scapegoat, and Alex was their scapegoat.\"Mr Cohen said Mr Kogan was not asking for any specific amount of money. \"We\\'re going to leave that to a jury,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nIn a statement, Liz Bourgeois, a spokeswoman for Facebook, described the action as a \"frivolous lawsuit\" from someone who \"violated our policies and put people\\'s data at risk\".\\nCambridge Analytica was founded by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor, and Steve Bannon, who would serve as an adviser to President Donald Trump.

       "  'Two of Facebook\\'s top executives - one regarded as the company\\'s No. 3, and the other the head of its WhatsApp messaging service - are leaving after disagreements with Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, over the social network\\'s future direction.The differences stemmed from Mr Zuckerberg\\'s asserting control over his company and its apps - Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger - by rolling out a plan to integrate the services into a single privacy-focused platform, according to six people involved in the situation.The change is a substantial shift for Facebook, which has traditionally encouraged people to publicly share posts, videos and photos. Executives at Facebook who had run the various services were concerned that knitting together the apps would take a toll on the popularity and growth of their individual products, said the people, who were not authorised to speak publicly. And with Mr Zuckerberg exerting more control, the executives were also fearful of losing autonomy and power, they said.Chris Cox, Facebook\\'s chief product officer and a member of Zuckerberg\\'s inner circle, is one of the two executives leaving. He alluded to the disagreements on Thursday in a public post about his departure. \"As Mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction,\" wrote Mr Cox, 36. \"This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through.\"The other executive who is exiting is Chris Daniels, 43, who runs WhatsApp. Neither one responded to requests for comment.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nTricky transition\\nFacebook is undergoing a tricky transition as it tries to recover from two years of scandals over data privacy and disinformation.

       "  'San FranciscoSOCIAL networking has long been predicated on people sharing their status updates, photos and messages with the world.Now Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, plans to start shifting people toward private conversations and away from public broadcasting. Zuckerberg, who runs Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, on Wednesday expressed his intentions to change the essential nature of social media.Instead of encouraging public posts, he said, he would focus on private and encrypted communications, in which users message mostly smaller groups of people they know. Unlike publicly shared posts that are kept as users\\' permanent records, the communications could also be deleted after a certain period of time.He said Facebook would achieve the shift partly by integrating Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger so that users worldwide could easily message one another across the networks. In effect, he said, Facebook would change from being a digital town square to creating a type of \"digital living room\", where people could expect their discussions to be intimate, ephemeral and secure from outsiders.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re building a foundation for social communication aligned with the direction people increasingly care about: messaging each other privately,\" Mr Zuckerberg said in an interview on Wednesday.\\nIn a blog post, he added that as he thought about the future of the internet, \"I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today\\'s open platforms.\" Facebook\\'s plan - in which the company is playing catch-up to the way people are already communicating digitally - raises new questions, not the least of which is whether it can realistically pull off a privacy-focused platform. The Silicon Valley giant, valued at US$490 billion, depends on people openly sharing posts to be able to target advertising to them. While the company will not eradicate public sharing, a proliferation of private and secure communications could potentially hurt its business model.\\nFacebook also faces concerns about what the change means for people\\'s data and whether it was being anti-competitive by knitting together WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, which historically have been separate and operated autonomously.\\nMr Zuckerberg was vague on many details of the shift, including how long it would take to enact and whether that meant Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger would share user information and other contact details with one another.

       " '07 Mar 2019': ['[SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said the future of his company\\'s product development will be focused on private, ephemeral and encrypted communication, a striking change for the social network that built its business on open sharing.More people want to interact privately or in more intimate groups online, instead of in \"the digital equivalent of a town square\" provided by Facebook and Instagram, Mr Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a blog post. To serve that demand, the world\\'s largest social-networking company will rebuild many of its features, he wrote, noting that smaller groups and more private, temporary posts are the fastest-growing areas of digital communications.\"I understand that many people don\\'t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform - because frankly we don\\'t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services, and we\\'ve historically focused on tools for more open sharing,\" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. \"But we\\'ve repeatedly shown that we can evolve to build the services that people really want, including in private messaging and stories.\"Mr Zuckerberg framed the strategy as a user choice, including the phrase \"people want\" six times in his blog post, and citing the fast growth of ephemeral and private communication on his company\\'s services. But it may benefit Facebook most by helping address two of the top issues weighing on the company: Users and governments are concerned about keeping personal information private on the social network, and Facebook has struggled to stop the spread of content that is false, violent or concerning in some way.In the post, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook\\'s move to encrypted messaging could be safer for government dissidents and others with controversial views. The shift could also create more online spaces that Facebook wouldn\\'t be able to monitor or police, at a time when encrypted and anonymous posts on Facebook\\'s WhatsApp messaging application are already helping fuel violence and conflict in places such as India.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nMr Zuckerberg didn\\'t explain how the move would affect Facebook\\'s advertising business.

       " '22 Feb 2019': ['Every single day, millions of people around the world share messages, videos and images with the people whom they care about, using Facebook. That also means that every single day, Facebook makes important decisions about what content stays up and what comes down, in line with our community standards. That has not always been easy as our experience around the world and in the Asia-Pacific has shown, but our priority remains keeping our global community safe, while making sure that everyone has a voice on issues which matter to them.Facebook is embarking on a year-long process beginning in Singapore this week to design a global body that will have the authority to review our most challenging and contentious content moderation decisions. The aim is that this board will exercise independent judgement when reviewing our most difficult and disputed content decisions and hold us publicly accountable if we do not get them right. We want the board to ensure that Facebook strikes the right balance between giving people a voice and keeping people safe from abusive, harmful or false content. This should - in time - bring more perspective, accountability and transparency to our content decisions. The board\\'s decisions will be binding. It will have the power to overrule or uphold Facebook\\'s content decisions and recommend changes or additions to policies if they are out of line with our values.Supporting this is a recently published draft charter outlining a model for how the board would operate. The charter includes a variety of considerations and questions that need to be answered in order to achieve our goal of convening an independent board: How many members should make up the board and how should they be selected? How should the board select cases to review? How can the board ensure cultural sensitivity and awareness when reviewing cases from all over the world? What level of transparency should the board give into its deliberations?In the workshop that we held this week in Singapore - the first of several to be held around the world - we brought together a group of 40 academics, experts and civil society from across the Asia-Pacific to start to answer those questions. Our aim is to listen to our partners\\' diverse range of perspectives, and incorporate them into the board\\'s design process. These insights will be critical in helping to design a board that can serve our global community and uphold our values, while bringing independent judgment to hard cases. Other workshops will follow this year in Delhi, Nairobi, Berlin, New York, Mexico City, with more to come.The success and the ultimate effectiveness of the board will depend on its ability to accommodate an inclusive and diverse range of perspectives, across language, culture and experience. Singapore - with its commitment to plurality - is an ideal place to start this global conversation. While the board cannot include representatives from every country and culture, the Asia-Pacific will be represented on the board alongside other regions. It will consist of up to 40 global experts with experience in content, privacy, free expression, human rights, journalism and safety. Where we need to, we will supplement member expertise through consultation with geographic and cultural experts to help ensure that decisions are fully informed. Above all, it is important that we achieve a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives to reflect our truly global community.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nThe establishment of the board will not interrupt or replace our efforts to address the challenges that we face, but instead will build on our recent investments and progress.

Former Nasa administrator Daniel Goldin founded a company called KnuEdge that was working on one such chip, but the company struggled to gain traction and in May announced it was laying off most of its workforce.Mr LeCun, who is also a professor of computer science at New York University, is considered one of the pioneers of a class of machine-learning techniques known as deep learning. The method depends on the use of large neural networks. He is especially known for applying these deep-learning techniques to computer vision tasks, such as identifying letters and numbers or tagging people and objects in images.

Europe has been the most aggressive in taking on Silicon Valley, but a tougher approach is gaining ground in the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission is considering imposing a multibillion dollar fine against Facebook, and lawmakers have called for new data-privacy regulations.The parliamentary report recommends the creation of a British watchdog to oversee the technology industry, similar to the country\\'s approach to regulating media companies.

       "  '[FRANKFURT] Germany\\'s competition watchdog is set to rule on Thursday on whether Facebook abused its dominant position in social media to collect excessive data and could even ban the site\\'s \"Like\" buttons from other webpages.Officials have been looking into Facebook since mid-2016, charging that the Silicon Valley giant uses other networks - such as subsidiaries Instagram and Whatsapp, as well as Twitter and other websites - to collect masses of information about users without their knowledge.That data then provides the foundation for Facebook\\'s advertising profits.Federal Cartel Office (FCO) chief Andreas Mundt will announce his findings in a press conference at 10am in Bonn.There is no danger Facebook will suffer swingeing fines like those imposed by Brussels on rival Google over competition misdeeds.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nBut the social network could be ordered to update its terms of use in Germany, Europe\\'s largest economy, or even see some of its functions banned.\\nMedia have reported that the \"Like\" buttons strewn around webpages -

Nor were campus maps that help people find their co-workers. They were unable to check Facebook\\'s latest shuttle bus schedule. And they could not see what the company\\'s cafeterias were serving for lunch.That\\'s because those features run on Facebook\\'s internal, custom-built iPhone apps - and Apple had shut them all down, according to nine current and former employees of the companies, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.The situation stemmed from a dispute after Facebook violated Apple\\'s rules by publicly distributing a research app that allowed it to snoop on users\\' online activity.

Yet the episode was a stark reminder of where the power really lies in the technology world.

       "  'IT IS easy to be outraged by the revelation\\xa0that Facebook has been paying users between the ages of 13\\xa0and 35 up to US$20 a month to allow practically unlimited access to their smartphone usage data. But outrage\\xa0about the social media giant is so 2017.\\xa0The latest dubious practice could be an opportunity to consider a more finely tuned business model than the one that Facebook uses today.According to an investigation\\xa0by Josh Constine for TechCrunch, the young users are paid for installing an app called Facebook Research, offered through the beta-testing services Applause, BetaBound and uTest, not directly by Facebook. The app asks users to install a root certificate, which gives Facebook access to pretty much everything that the phone contains, from private message exchanges to location data.This sounds like spying on young people who may not understand what they are allowing, and appears to contradict Apple\\'s app store policies. After the TechCrunch report came out, Facebook said that it would remove the app from the store; it would still be available for Android phones, though.In a statement, Facebook said\\xa0that the users knew what they were doing; they had given their permission and taken the money, and the 5 per cent of the participating users who were teens had all provided signed parental consent forms.\\xa0I am not going to split hairs about whether Facebook made crystal clear to the users (and to the parents who signed these forms)\\xa0what level of access they would be providing. Facebook has a poor record of explaining how much data it collects and how.In the wholesale market for personal data, companies trade or use our information to target advertising. The average value of an active user to Facebook, based on its most recent earnings release, reached about US$2 per month in the third quarter of 2018; in the US and Canada, it was about US$9.20. The more precisely\\xa0data can be targeted to a user, the more that user is worth.\\xa0Clearly, a person\\'s data cannot be worth more to an ad-driven business than the ad revenue that person can bring in.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nSo US$20 a\\xa0month should not seem a paltry sum for running the Facebook Research app, even if the highly granular data that is collected do not just improve targeting precision but also help\\xa0the giant find startups to acquire or outcompete.\\xa0 The problem is that while a wholesale market for personal data exists, a retail one does not.\\nThat is a shame. The actual owners and real-time producers of data -\\xa0we the people -should have a say in how much our information is worth.\\xa0\\nCompanies that make money from online advertising should give us an explicit opportunity to sell them our data. The incentive for companies would be that users who sell their data would sign away their privacy through a simple waiver. Like the participants in the Facebook research programme, they would knowingly let the social media site get everything that it can from their phones.\\xa0\\nI imagine quite a few people would agree because they already police their phone use so as to have few secrets. Many employers\\xa0install tracking apps on company phones. Young people, too, might\\xa0attach relatively little value to their routine communications, Internet and app use data.\\nSuch contracts, of course, would make it necessary for other users to be able to cut off communications on the platform with people who are giving up their data for cash: Message exchanges with them would be exposed. That, however, can be solved with a single checkbox in the settings.\\nWith a broader base of paid users giving up all their data, Facebook could fine-tune its ad-targeting techniques,\\xa0make better inferences about its entire universe of users and perhaps even run behavioural experiments that otherwise would be\\xa0considered unethical. It would have blanket permission for all that in exchange for a fee that would, in the end, be determined by the market.\\nThe\\xa0users who do not want to participate\\xa0could remain in the free layer, based on the same rules that determine Facebook\\'s data collection today. They would still give up some data -\\xa0as much as Facebook can trick them into releasing. And they would see more or less precisely targeted ads based on their settings.\\xa0\\nI am also in favour of introducing a third, subscription-based layer, for which Facebook would guarantee no data collection and no ads. The subscription fees could offset the money paid to people selling their data; theoretically, the point at which this happens would set the market-clearing retail price of our Web privacy.\\xa0\\nIntroducing the three layers would go a long way towards fixing Facebook\\'s regulatory problems: It would be hard to argue with a market-based mechanism for setting privacy levels. At the same time, it would allow the company to retain an advertising-based business model, which chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has said he prefers to a\\xa0subscription-based one. Many users, after all, would prefer to stay in the free layer on today\\'s terms.\\nFacebook has often objected to regulation, arguing that it would stifle innovation. The company should take a more innovative approach both to people\\'s privacy preferences and to its business model. Instead of apologising for one privacy invasion after another, it should give users a way to decide how much\\xa0they value their data.

2018 have not had a lasting impact on its ability to increase both revenues and usage,\" said analyst Debra Aho Williamson of the research firm eMarketer.\"Advertisers are clearly still very reliant on Facebook, and the fact that daily active usage in both the US/Canada and Europe increased is a surprise after the flatness we saw in the US and Canada last year and the falloff we saw in Europe.\"Facebook has pledged to hire thousands of employees and invest in new technologies to respond to concerns about manipulation and abuse, and to take data protection more seriously.The number of employees as of December 31 was 35,587, an increase of 42 per cent year-over-year.\"We\\'ve fundamentally changed how we run our company to focus on the biggest social issues, and we\\'re investing more to build new and inspiring ways for people to connect,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.According to eMarketer, Facebook\\'s share of the global digital ad market will be 20.5 per cent of an overall US$327.28 billion spent in 2019.But analysts say the trust issue is crucial for Facebook if it wants to move forward on its mission to connect the world.Facebook estimated that approximately 2.7 billion people use its \"family\" of services including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and its core social network.The company faces demographic challenges as younger users shift to other platforms, seeing Facebook as less cool than it was.Analysts are watching to see whether it will compensate with gains in other services, including its popular visual social network Instagram, messaging services

       " '24 Dec 2018': ['New YorkAFTER a year-long string of news reports that have called Facebook\\'s data-sharing practices into question, US federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users.It is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were levelled by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices. That agreement, called a consent decree, provides a roadmap for how the FTC is likely to scrutinise Facebook over the coming months.Why did the FTC accuse Facebook of deceptive privacy practices in the first place?In 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users\\' online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis. Facebook\\'s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, apologised with what an article in The New York Times described as a \"symphony of contrition\". In a Facebook post that year, he wrote: \"I\\'m not proud of the way we\\'ve handled this situation and I know we can do better.\"\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nAt the end of 2009, a coalition of non-profit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the FTC to investigate Facebook\\'s handling of user data. The groups filed a complaint, saying Facebook had repeatedly disregarded users\\' expectations and diminished their privacy. The complaint argued that the company had violated a federal law prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices. In 2011, the FTC filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy.\\nWhat were the FTC\\'s charges against Facebook?\\nThe FTC\\'s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them:\\nFacebook shared users\\' personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said.\\nFacebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all their personal data - even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said.\\nIn 2009, the agency said Facebook changed its information-handling practices, making certain personal details - such as users\\' friends lists - public, overriding the choices of people who wanted to keep that data private. The policy change, the FTC\\'s complaint said, exposed users\\' profile information, including \"potentially controversial political views or other sensitive information\", to third parties.\\nThe agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its \"Verified Apps program\", but the company did not do so.\\nWhat did the FTC require Facebook to do?\\nIn November 2011, Facebook agreed to settle complaints that it had deceived consumers by \"telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public\", the FTC said in a statement at the time.\\nThe agreement, which became final in 2012, prohibited Facebook from misleading consumers about their data privacy and security. The social network committed to getting the explicit consent of users before making changes that overrode their privacy preferences.\\nThe agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users\\' information and to manage the risks of existing and new products. It also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company\\'s users.\\nWhy is the federal consent agreement relevant now?\\nIn March 2018, The New York Times reported that a voter-profiling company, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or permission. The voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook.\\nAlthough only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users\\' friends - consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported.\\nPrivacy experts, law professors and at least one former FTC official have argued that Facebook\\'s failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users\\' friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook\\'s failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users\\' data and the data of users\\' friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said.\\nThey said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users\\' friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said.\\nThey also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions - steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree.\\n\"The consent decree requires Facebook to always be vigilant to possible privacy problems and try to solve them,\" said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former director of consumer protection at the FTC who oversaw the investigation that led to the consent decree. \"Cambridge Analytica made clear that Facebook was not auditing third-party apps.\"\\nOn Mar 26, the FTC said it was conducting an investigation into Facebook\\'s privacy practices. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment on the progress of the investigation.\\nWhat does Facebook say?\\nFacebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree.\\n\"We are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people\\'s privacy settings,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \"We have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people\\'s information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services.\"\\nMs Aldous said the company\\'s privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms - including a privacy governance team and security teams that \"ensure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed and escalated for decisions when necessary\".\\nFacebook said it disagreed with The Times\\' characterisation of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies. The social network said device-makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes. The company also said Spotify and other third-party apps had access to users\\' Facebook data only after users signed in with their Facebook account in the third-party apps.

A conservative commentator in Mississippi who rants about America\\'s priorities from his car.These are some of the video-makers who in recent months have started making serious money from Facebook Watch, the tech giant\\'s answer to YouTube.Julius Dein, the magician, said his videos had attracted revenue in the \"six figures\" since July, when he became able to run ads on them. The prankster brothers, known as the Jalals, said they had earned more than US$500,000 since August.While Facebook grapples with growing regulatory scrutiny and a string of crises around data misuse on its platform, its ambitious growth plans have not slowed.

So siphoning some of the more than US$60 billion in advertising money that\\'s now directed toward TV and bringing it to Watch has become a central goal.\\nBut creating a space that can attract that money has been a challenge for Facebook.

This most recent incident is somewhat less severe than previous ones. Around 1,500 third-party apps had access to users\\' uploaded photos — even if they had not posted them publicly to Facebook — from Sept 13 to Sept 25.Facebook said the number of people affected was probably smaller than 6.8 million, because it doubted that all 1,500 apps gained access to the social network during that 12-day period. The company said it was contacting the 876 developers who built the apps and asking them to check and delete any photos they may have retrieved improperly.The announcement is likely to raise questions among federal regulators about whether Facebook violated a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Under the agreement, Facebook is prohibited from misrepresenting its privacy and security practices. It also requires the company to obtain users\\' consent before overriding their privacy choices, and to institute a comprehensive program to protect the privacy and security of users\\' data.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nThe company\\'s main data-protection regulator in the European Union, the Irish Data Protection Commission, said Friday that the mounting number of problems required a deeper investigation.\\nThe company found the bug Sept 25, the same day Facebook discovered a data breach that affected 30 million users.

       " '11 Dec 2018': ['CanberraGOOGLE and Facebook Inc face a regulatory crackdown in Australia after the nation\\'s competition watchdog joined a chorus of international criticism over their use of data and the market power they wield across news and advertising.In a preliminary report released on Monday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said a new or existing watchdog should investigate and monitor how large digital platforms rank and display adverts and news. It also expressed concern about a lack of transparency in how their key algorithms work. \"The ACCC considers that the strong market position of digital platforms like Google and Facebook justifies a greater level of regulatory oversight,\" chairman Rod Sims said. The report contains 11 preliminary recommendations and eight areas for further analysis as the inquiry continues.The tech giants have come under increased scrutiny internationally amid concern about the dissemination of fake news and their potential to dominate online advertising. US lawmakers have lambasted Facebook for failing to stop a flood of Russian propaganda during the 2016 election, while European regulators are looking at the advertising practices of digital platforms. \"This is a sign that Australia is looking to follow Europe\\'s lead in putting some sort of restrictions on these two companies\\' enormous sway in the market,\" said Andrew Hughes, a lecturer in marketing at the Australian National University. \"It\\'s hard to think that this will curtail their dominance, but at least it\\'s a start in drawing a line and saying there needs to be more oversight.\"The ACCC said Google and Facebook had become the \"dominant gateways between news media businesses and audiences\", leading to a loss of advertising revenue and ultimately cuts in the number of journalists who could play an important role in \"exposing corruption and holding governments, companies, powerful individuals and institutions to account\". The competition watchdog said its \"preliminary view is that consumers face a potential risk of filter bubbles, or echo chambers, and less reliable news on digital platforms\".

Mark Zuckerberg for not answering questions on the matter.Facebook is being investigated by lawmakers in Britain after consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump\\'s presidential campaign, obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher, drawing attention to the use of data analytics in politics.Concerns over the social media giant\\'s practices, the role of political adverts and possible interference in the 2016 Brexit vote and US elections are among the topics being investigated by British and European regulators.While Facebook says it complies with EU data protection laws, a special hearing of lawmakers from several countries around the world in London criticised Zuckerberg for declining to appear himself to answer questions on the

repeatedly declined to give an example of a person or app banned from Facebook for misuse of data, aside from the GSR app which gathered data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\\nLegal documents reviewed by Reuters show how the investigation by British lawmakers has led them to seize documents relating to Facebook from app developer Six4Three, which is in a legal dispute with

But now a bitter legal dispute between the app maker and the social networking giant is threatening to strip bare Facebook\\'s often-criticized practices for sharing what users post on the network.Sensitive internal Facebook records that were supposed to remain sealed in a California court case were leaked to a U.K. parliamentary committee by one of the founders of the app company.

       " '26 Nov 2018': ['THE facebook platform has been used to disrupt elections, disseminate propaganda and promote hate. Regular users should ask if they are implicated in these failings.I joined Facebook in 2008, and for the most part, I have benefited from being on it. Lately, however, I have wondered whether I should delete my Facebook account. As a philosopher with a special interest in ethics, I am using \"should\" in the moral sense. That is, in light of recent events implicating Facebook in objectionable behaviour, is there a duty to leave it?In moral philosophy, it is common to draw a distinction between duties to oneself and duties to others. From a self-regarding perspective, there are numerous reasons one might have a duty to leave Facebook. For one thing, Facebook can be time-consuming and addictive, to no fruitful end. In addition, as researchers have demonstrated, Facebook use can worsen depression and anxiety. Someone who finds himself mindlessly and compulsively scrolling through Facebook, or who is constantly comparing himself unfavourably with his Facebook friends, might therefore have a duty of self-care to get off Facebook.From the perspective of one\\'s duties to others, the possibility of a duty to leave Facebook arises once one recognises that Facebook has played a significant role in undermining democratic values around the world. For example, Facebook has been used to spread white supremacist propaganda and anti-Semitic messages in and outside the United States. The United Nations has blamed Facebook for the dissemination of hate speech against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar that resulted in their ethnic cleansing.Facebook also enabled the political data firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal information of millions of voters in the United States so they could be targeted with personalised political advertisements. A significant amount of fake news can be found on Facebook, and for many users, Facebook has become a large echo chamber, where people merely seek out information that reinforces their views.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nSome people might think that because they mostly share photos of their cats on Facebook, such concerns do not apply to them. But this is not so, for three reasons. First, even if one does not contribute directly to the dissemination of fake news or hang out in echo chambers, simply being on Facebook encourages one\\'s friends to stay on Facebook, and some of those friends might engage in such activities. This influence on others is known as a (positive) network effect, where increased numbers of people improve the value of a product.\\nSecond, by being on Facebook one serves as a data point for Facebook\\'s social media experiment, even if one encounters none of Facebook\\'s experimental manipulations. In doing so, one could be helping Facebook to refine its algorithms so that it can better single out specific individuals for certain purposes, some of which could be as nefarious as those of Cambridge Analytica.\\nConsider an analogy. When testing the safety and efficacy of new drugs, subjects are randomly assigned either to an experimental group or a control group, and only subjects in the experimental group receive the new drug. Nevertheless, the subjects in the control group are essential to the experiment.\\nThird, using Facebook is not just an individual action but also a collective one that may be akin to failing to pay taxes. A few people failing to pay taxes might not make much of a difference to a government\\'s budget, but such an action may nevertheless be wrong because it is a failure to participate in a collective action that achieves a certain good end.\\nIn a similar vein, choosing to remain on Facebook might not directly undermine democratic values. But such an action could also be wrong because we might be failing to participate in a collective action (that is, leaving Facebook) that would prevent the deterioration of democracy.\\nCrossing red lines\\nSo do we have an obligation to leave Facebook for others\\' sake? The answer is a resounding yes for those who are intentionally spreading hate speech and fake news on Facebook. For those of us who do not engage in such objectionable behaviour, it is helpful to consider whether Facebook has crossed certain moral \"red lines,\" entering the realm of outright wickedness.\\nFor me at least, Facebook would have crossed a moral red line if it had, for example, intentionally sold the data of its users to Cambridge Analytica with the full knowledge that the company would use the data subversively to influence a democratic election. Likewise, Facebook would have crossed a red line if it had intentionally assisted in the dissemination of hate speech in Myanmar. But the evidence indicates that Facebook did not intend for those things to occur on its platform.\\nBut the fact that those things did occur means that Facebook needs to be much more proactive in fixing such problems. Will it? The recent worrisome revelation that Facebook hired an opposition-research firm that attempted to discredit protesters by claiming that they were agents of the financier George Soros is not encouraging. While there still appears to be some daylight between Facebook and what is being done on its platform or in its name, darkness is crowding in.\\nThat said, we should not place the responsibility to uphold democratic values entirely on Facebook. As moral agents, we should also hold ourselves responsible for our conduct, and we should be reflective about what we say, react to and share when we are on social media.\\nAmong Twitter users, a common refrain is \"retweets are not endorsements\". In a similar manner, one might also think that \"sharing\" or \"reacting to\" are not \"endorsements\". This is a mistake. By sharing or reacting to a post, even if one explicitly criticises the post, one is amplifying the message of that post and signalling that the post warrants further attention.\\nFor now I\\'m going to stay on Facebook.

There\\'s a walking trail with indigenous plants and a juice bar.But the tone among highly sought-after computer scientists about the social network is changing. On a recent night at the University of California, Berkeley, as a group of young engineers gathered to show off their tech skills, many said they would avoid taking jobs at the social network.\"I\\'ve heard a lot of employees who work there don\\'t even use it,\" said Niky Arora, 19, an engineering student, who was recently invited to a Facebook recruiting event at the company\\'s headquarters in Menlo Park. \"I just don\\'t believe in the product because like, Facebook, the baseline of everything they do is desire to show people more ads.\"Emily Zhong, 20, a computer science major, piped up. \"Surprisingly, a lot of my friends now are like: \\'I don\\'t really want to work for Facebook,\\'\" she said, citing \"privacy stuff, fake news, personal data, all of it\".\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\n\"Before it was this glorious, magical thing to work there,\" said Jazz Singh, 18, and also studying computer science. \"Now it\\'s like, just because it does what you want doesn\\'t mean it\\'s doing good.\"\\nAs Facebook has been rocked by scandal after scandal, some young engineers are souring on the company.

       " datetime.date(2019, 4, 13): 'Menlo Park, CaliforniaFOR years, Facebook has built its algorithms to maximise engagement and clicks - a strategy that has helped the company garner 2.7 billion users across its family of apps, including Instagram and Messenger. But increasingly, it is willing to go up against the way its software is designed to combat the spread of harmful content.On Wednesday, the company announced a slew of new features and incremental product updates that counter the core engineering of its own systems by tweaking them to do more to reduce the spread of misinformation and sensational news - borderline content that the company won\\'t remove entirely but is taking a more active role in policing.For example, it will update its scrolling news feed algorithm by reviewing little-known websites whose articles get sudden surges of traffic on Facebook - a pattern that internal tests showed were a red flag for misinformation and clickbait. The new metric does not mean the problematic articles will be taken down, but their traffic will be reduced in news feed, the primary screen Facebook users see when they open the app.The question is whether these changes are tweaks on the margins or more fundamental fixes. The newsfeed algorithm alone takes in hundreds of thousands of behavioural signals when it evaluates which posts get promotion - and it\\'s tough to assess the impact any single fix might have on such a complex system.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nThe company will also expand fact-checking features for images, add privacy features to Messenger, and do more to take action on posts, images, hashtags and other content or behaviour that it calls \"borderline\" - material or actions that don\\'t technically violate the company\\'s rules but can lead to harmful outcomes.\\n\"As content gets closer and closer to the line of community standards, we actually see that it gets more and more engagement,\" said Facebook operations specialist Henry Silverman.\\nFacebook may be making some progress in reducing the viral spread of false information in the US.

REGN NO. 198402668E, IN a recent opinion article, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he agreed with the growing consensus that Facebook - and other social media companies - should be subject to more regulation. The article, published in four countries and three languages, was fated to be misunderstood from the start.His first suggestion was to create an independent body so users could appeal against Facebook\\'s moderation decisions. Over the past few years, Facebook has caught fire from all sides for its content moderation. Some say hate speech should be censored more aggressively. At the same time, the company has been accused of censoring conservative viewpoints. And for years, it has been roundly criticised for its puritanical ban on female nipples.But if Facebook had its way, the ultimate authority would no longer lie with Facebook - or Twitter or YouTube or other competitors. That job would fall to unspecified \"regulators\". \"Regulation could set baselines for what\\'s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum,\" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. For a company exhausted by a year of scandal, a regulatory scapegoat is just what the doctor ordered. If you don\\'t like what we do, why don\\'t you try it for a change?US legal experts were incredulous. Daphne Keller of the Stanford Center for Internet and Society accused Facebook of proposing an unconstitutional system, knowing it was impossible. In an initial statement, Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union said it was a violation of the First Amendment. The Electronic Frontier Foundation claimed it would violate the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Facebook\\'s head of public policy, Kevin Martin, explained that while Mr Zuckerberg\\'s reference to \"regulation\" might mean actual government intervention in France, Germany and Ireland, it meant only private sector self-regulation in the United States.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nThis kind of faux regulation is nothing new. Among the examples cited were FINRA, a nongovernmental financial industry \"regulator\"; the Motion Picture Association of America, which rates films; and the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rates video games. (After this clarification, the ACLU\\'s Wizner agreed that independent bodies like the MPAA are not unconstitutional).\\nBut none of these examples deal with directly regulating speech. Social media content moderation is a different beast entirely. Slapping a label on a video game isn\\'t the same as banning distribution of the video game.\\nFacebook avoided bringing up the Hays Code, the closest corollary to what they propose. The MPAA\\'s rating system is a pale shadow of Hollywood\\'s old Hays Code, the now-laughable list of rules that for years had on-screen husbands and wives sleeping in separate beds.\\nThe Code was developed voluntarily by the studios in hopes of avoiding government censorship. It zealously policed depictions of romance, crime, law enforcement and the clergy.

REGN NO. 198402668E, WashingtonFACEBOOK has come under fire for its speech policies from multiple players in multiple nations for manifold reasons - sometimes for taking down too much content, other times for not taking down enough. Now, Mark Zuckerberg is asking for someone to tell him what to do instead. That\\'s an understandable but potentially dangerous request.Some have interpreted Mr Zuckerberg\\'s calls for greater regulation of content moderation, along with comments from Facebook\\'s head of global affairs this past weekend, as requests for a worldwide standard-setting on speech. But any international rules would be formed in part by repressive regimes - putting the Internet\\'s future in the hands of autocrats. No one set of rules can work for all countries, and people\\'s ability to express themselves online should not become a geopolitical bargaining chip.More likely, Facebook and its peers will be regulated country by country. That is more reasonable, though there are risks there, too. Australia has proposed throwing executives in jail if they let violent videos linger on their sites. Germany fines companies for illegal hate speech. Britain is consideringvhefty fines for \"harmful content\". What \"harmful\" means is unclear - and that\\'s precisely the problem.It is one thing for US legislators to hold companies accountable for acting recklessly with regard to illegal content, such as incitements to violence, though that is the sort of regulation Mr Zuckerberg almost certainly does not want. Letting legislators tell tech companies to ban even some categories of legal speech, on the other hand, would almost certainly be a violation of the First Amendment in the United States. Elsewhere, it would be a serious threat to free speech.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nFacebook\\'s head of public policyvclarified that Mr Zuckerberg does not want the US government to set speech rules, even if other countries might.

PROBES\\xa0Brian Krebs, of security news website KrebsOnSecurity.com, cited an unnamed Facebook source as saying the internal investigation had so far indicated that as many as 600 million users of the social network had account passwords stored in plain text files searchable by more than 20,000 employees.The exact number had yet to be determined, but archives with unencrypted user passwords were found dating back to the year 2012, according to Krebs.Facebook\\'s admission of the faux pas came after the report by Krebs.\"We have fixed these issues and as a precaution we will be notifying everyone whose passwords we have found were stored in this way,\" Mr Canahuati said.Facebook\\'s practice is to mask people\\'s passwords by replacing them with random characters and then tucking away software keys needed to make sense of the jumble, according to Mr Canahuati.The technique allows Facebook\\'s system to recognise valid passwords when users log in, without storing the information in plain text that employees or hackers could read.Facebook said that social network users could harden security by updating to complex passwords and opting to require a second piece of data such as a texted code to access accounts.Regulators, investigators and elected officials around the world have already been digging into the data sharing practices of Facebook which has more than two billion users.The social network\\'s handling of user data has been a flashpoint for controversy since it admitted last year that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, used an app that may have hijacked the private details of 87 million users.Facebook has announced a series of moves to tighten handling of data, including eliminating most of its data-sharing partnerships with outside companies.Last week the social network announced that its chief product officer Chris Cox was leaving, becoming the highest-ranking executive to depart amid the turmoil at the leading social network.Mr Cox made his announcement on his Facebook page, saying he was leaving \"with great sadness\" after 13 years.While Mr Cox gave no specific reason for his move, he noted that Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has unveiled a new direction away from being the \"digital town square\" to focus on smaller-scale, private interactions.\"As Mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction, focused on an encrypted, interoperable, messaging network,\" Mr Cox wrote.\"This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction

       " datetime.date(2019, 3, 21): 'CRITICISM of big tech companies that track us across the Internet without our informed consent misses a bigger picture: There are hundreds of ad-tracking companies that do the same,\\xa0and regulators have been powerless to rein them in.A report by the Danish privacy consulting firm Cookiebot says that 112\\xa0ad-tracking companies collect information about visitors to government and public sector websites in European Union countries, even though\\xa0the websites are not ad-supported. Of these, 52 were found on French government sites; German taxpayer-funded sites were found to be the best protected, yet one-third of their pages still contained advertising trackers.If you don\\'t recall authorising\\xa0that activity, that\\'s because you didn\\'t. Even if you clicked on an \"I accept cookies\" pop-up, which probably didn\\'t explain properly what cookies you were accepting, it didn\\'t cover all of the trackers. Some\\xa0were smuggled in.\"Modern websites typically include multiple third party javascript technologies to power various functions, such as video players, social sharing widgets, web analytics, galleries and comments sections,\" Cookiebot wrote. \"These scripts can act as Trojan horses, opening backdoors to the website code through which ad tech companies can silently insert their trackers.\"Government websites are often built on the cheap\\xa0and include all kinds of third-party components. So not even the governments of EU member states comply with the union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires site administrators to make sure users consent to the collection of their data. If you visit a national health service website with questions\\xa0about whether you are HIV positive, pregnant\\xa0or sliding into alcoholism\\xa0there\\'s a good chance you\\'re being watched in order to be targeted with ads.

       " datetime.date(2019, 3, 17): '[WASHINGTON] The academic who helped Cambridge Analytica vacuum up private information from tens of millions of Facebook profiles sued the social media giant Friday, arguing that the company defamed him when it claimed he had lied about how the data was going to be used.Since the full scope of Cambridge Analytica\\'s data mining was revealed last year, Facebook has repeatedly tried to shift blame for the privacy breach onto the academic, Alexander Kogan. Facebook executives — including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg — have said Mr Kogan told Facebook that the data was for academic purposes when it was being collected for use in political campaigns.Mr Kogan, 32, a former psychology professor, used a quiz app to collect the data, and has insisted that the fine print accompanying his app said the information could be used commercially. That was an outright violation of Facebook\\'s rules at the time, but the company does not appear to have regularly checked that apps were complying.\"Alex did not lie, Alex was not a fraud, Alex did not deceive them, this was not a scam,\" said Steve Cohen, a lawyer for Mr Kogan. \"Facebook knew exactly what this app was doing, or should have known. Facebook desperately needed a scapegoat, and Alex was their scapegoat.\"Mr Cohen said Mr Kogan was not asking for any specific amount of money. \"We\\'re going to leave that to a jury,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nIn a statement, Liz Bourgeois, a spokeswoman for Facebook, described the action as a \"frivolous lawsuit\" from someone who \"violated our policies and put people\\'s data at risk\".\\nCambridge Analytica was founded by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor, and Steve Bannon, who would serve as an adviser to President Donald Trump.

REGN NO. 198402668E, Two of Facebook\\'s top executives - one regarded as the company\\'s No. 3, and the other the head of its WhatsApp messaging service - are leaving after disagreements with Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, over the social network\\'s future direction.The differences stemmed from Mr Zuckerberg\\'s asserting control over his company and its apps - Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger - by rolling out a plan to integrate the services into a single privacy-focused platform, according to six people involved in the situation.The change is a substantial shift for Facebook, which has traditionally encouraged people to publicly share posts, videos and photos. Executives at Facebook who had run the various services were concerned that knitting together the apps would take a toll on the popularity and growth of their individual products, said the people, who were not authorised to speak publicly. And with Mr Zuckerberg exerting more control, the executives were also fearful of losing autonomy and power, they said.Chris Cox, Facebook\\'s chief product officer and a member of Zuckerberg\\'s inner circle, is one of the two executives leaving. He alluded to the disagreements on Thursday in a public post about his departure. \"As Mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction,\" wrote Mr Cox, 36. \"This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through.\"The other executive who is exiting is Chris Daniels, 43, who runs WhatsApp. Neither one responded to requests for comment.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nTricky transition\\nFacebook is undergoing a tricky transition as it tries to recover from two years of scandals over data privacy and disinformation. Those issues have buffeted the Silicon Valley giant, causing internal turmoil as its leaders have tried to find a way to adjust. Mr Zuckerberg has made several attempts to rid Facebook of toxic content, false news and other problems, with limited success.\\nNow, he is barrelling ahead with his shift to focus Facebook on private messaging and away from public broadcasting, even if it means shedding some of his top lieutenants.\\nMr Cox has worked with Mr Zuckerberg for 13 years and joined Facebook as one of its first 15 software engineers. Mr Cox also was instrumental in building the News Feed, the stream of posts that people see when they log into the service, and which more recently has been under scrutiny for being a hive of misinformation. Among some in Silicon Valley, he had been mentioned as a possible successor to Mr Zuckerberg.\\n\"Embarking on this new vision represents the start of a new chapter for us,\" Mr Zuckerberg said in a note to staff on Thursday. \"While it is sad to lose such great people, this also creates opportunities for more great leaders who are energised about the path ahead to take on new and bigger roles.\"\\nExecutive turnover\\nThe departures add to the executive turnover at Facebook, which for years had been stable in its top ranks.

Among some in Silicon Valley, he had been mentioned as a possible successor to Mr Zuckerberg.\"Embarking on this new vision represents the start of a new chapter for us,\" Mr Zuckerberg said in a note to staff on Thursday. \"While it is sad to lose such great people, this also creates opportunities for more great leaders who are energised about the path ahead to take on new and bigger roles.\"Executive turnoverThe departures add to the executive turnover at Facebook, which for years had been stable in its top ranks. Mr Zuckerberg kept close many key executives, including his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, as well as Mr Cox and others.But that bench has undergone numerous changes more recently as Facebook has grappled with its lapses and tried to reorient itself. Last year, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the co-founders of Instagram, left the company after clashing with Mr Zuckerberg over the future of the photo-sharing network. Jan Koum and Brian Acton, the co-founders of WhatsApp, also left after similar disagreements with Mr Zuckerberg.Other executives, including Facebook\\'s head of communications and policy and its security chief, have also departed.Ben Horowitz, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, said on Twitter that Mr Zuckerberg\\'s new direction for Facebook was controversial because it was such a cultural departure for what had been an open and public social network.But he said Mr Zuckerberg appeared committed to privacy by plowing ahead with the changes even \"in the face of extremely strong dissent\".\"So much so, that he is willing to lose outstanding executives who disagree with this direction,\" said Mr Horowitz,who is a partner at Andreessen Horowitz with Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist who sits on Facebook\\'s board.Mounting frustrationInside Facebook, frustration over Mr Zuckerberg\\'s planned changes have been mounting for months, said the people involved the situation. Combining Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger will be a companywide effort that will take years of infrastructure work and deep changes to some of its products, they said.Mr Daniels, who previously ran Facebook\\'s business development team and had other roles, was appointed head of WhatsApp last May. He disagreed with some of the choices that were being made to connect the apps, said people familiar with his thinking. He was also concerned that Mr Zuckerberg\\'s plan would harm the success of WhatsApp, which is particularly popular outside the United States.Because of those changes, Mr Daniels handed in his resignation months ago, said two of the people, though the decision did not become public until Thursday.Mr Cox has also been frustrated with Mr Zuckerberg\\'s decisions in recent months, some of the people said. Less than a year ago, Mr Cox shifted into one of the most powerful positions at Facebook as chief product officer, responsible for overseeing Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook itself.Almost immediately, he ran into difficulties, the people said. Employees said he disagreed with some of Zuckerberg\\'s product ideas and changes, including the \"unified messaging\" project intended to connect the apps.Mr Zuckerberg has promoted others to take the place of those who have left. Adam Mosseri, a longtime Facebook employee, was promoted to head of Instagram last year.On Thursday, Mr Zuckerberg said Will Cathcart, another Facebook employee, would run WhatsApp, and Fidji Simo would lead Facebook\\'s main app. NYTIMESSPH Digital News© 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

The issues have buffeted the Silicon Valley company, causing internal turmoil and a redirection in strategy.Last week, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, announced that Facebook would shift away from public sharing of posts and focus on private conversations across the company\\'s messaging services — WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger. The decision, which involves knitting together three of the world\\'s largest digital communications services, was controversial internally and has upset some employees who were asked to work on the project, according to current and former employees who were not authorised to speak publicly.The two executives leaving Facebook are Chris Cox, chief product officer and one of the social network\\'s highest-ranking executives, and Chris Daniels, head of WhatsApp.Mr Cox has long been in Mr Zuckerberg\\'s inner circle.

       " datetime.date(2019, 3, 14): '[LONDON] Britain needs to overhaul its competition rules to tackle the dominance of tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon, and increase consumer choice, a government review said on Wednesday.A new competition unit with expertise in the sector should be set up, the independent review said, and innovation should be encouraged by giving people control over their own data so they could switch between rival services and platforms easily.Smaller companies should also have access to the data that social media platforms hold on their users, it recommended.Big tech has been criticised by politicians in the United States and in Europe in recent years over issues ranging from Facebook losing track of users\\' data to how Google ranks the results of searches.France, Italy, Britain and Spain have also proposed new digital taxes to narrow loopholes that allow large multinational firms to cut tax bills.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: Google\\'s

REGN NO. 198402668E, San FranciscoSOCIAL networking has long been predicated on people sharing their status updates, photos and messages with the world.Now Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, plans to start shifting people toward private conversations and away from public broadcasting. Zuckerberg, who runs Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, on Wednesday expressed his intentions to change the essential nature of social media.Instead of encouraging public posts, he said, he would focus on private and encrypted communications, in which users message mostly smaller groups of people they know. Unlike publicly shared posts that are kept as users\\' permanent records, the communications could also be deleted after a certain period of time.He said Facebook would achieve the shift partly by integrating Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger so that users worldwide could easily message one another across the networks. In effect, he said, Facebook would change from being a digital town square to creating a type of \"digital living room\", where people could expect their discussions to be intimate, ephemeral and secure from outsiders.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re building a foundation for social communication aligned with the direction people increasingly care about: messaging each other privately,\" Mr Zuckerberg said in an interview on Wednesday.\\nIn a blog post, he added that as he thought about the future of the internet, \"I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today\\'s open platforms.\" Facebook\\'s plan - in which the company is playing catch-up to the way people are already communicating digitally - raises new questions, not the least of which is whether it can realistically pull off a privacy-focused platform. The Silicon Valley giant, valued at US$490 billion, depends on people openly sharing posts to be able to target advertising to them. While the company will not eradicate public sharing, a proliferation of private and secure communications could potentially hurt its business model.\\nFacebook also faces concerns about what the change means for people\\'s data and whether it was being anti-competitive by knitting together WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, which historically have been separate and operated autonomously.\\nMr Zuckerberg was vague on many details of the shift, including how long it would take to enact and whether that meant Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger would share user information and other contact details with one another. He did not address how private, encrypted communications would affect Facebook\\'s bottom line.\\nBut he did acknowledge the scepticism that Facebook would be able to change. \"Frankly we don\\'t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services, and we\\'ve historically focused on tools for more open sharing,\" he wrote in his blog post.\\n\"But we\\'ve repeatedly shown that we can evolve to build the services that people really want, including in private messaging and stories.\"\\nFacebook\\'s move is set to redefine how people use social media and how they will connect with one another. That has societal, political and national security implications given the grip that the company\\'s services have on more than 2.7 billion users around the world. In some countries, Facebook and its other apps are often considered as being the internet.\\nMr Zuckerberg\\'s decision follows years of scandal for the social network, much of it originating from public sharing of posts. Foreign agents from countries like Russia have used Facebook to publish disinformation, in an attempt to sway elections. Some communities have used Facebook Groups to strengthen ideologies around issues such as anti-vaccination. And firms have harvested the material that people openly shared for all manner of purposes, including targeting advertising and creating voter profiles.\\nMr Zuckerberg has repeatedly tried to rid Facebook of toxic content, disinformation and other problems. At one point, he emphasised prioritising what friends and family shared on Facebook and de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands. He has also said that the company will hire more people to comb through and remove abusive or dangerous posts, and that it is working on artificial intelligence tools to do that job.\\nBut none of those moves addressed the issue of public sharing. And in many ways, consumers were already moving en masse toward more private methods of digital communications.\\nIn many ways, Mr Zuckerberg is now emulating a strategy popularised by Tencent, the Chinese internet company that makes the messaging app WeChat. WeChat has become the de facto portal to the rest of the internet for Chinese citizens because through the app, users can perform a multitude of tasks, like pay for items, communicate with friends and order takeout.\\n\"Facebook is focused on mobile and messaging as the key conduit for people to communicate online, and thereby to communicate with Facebook,\" said Ashkan Soltani, an independent privacy and security researcher who was a former chief technologist at the FTC. \"The chat app essentially becomes your browser.\"\\nMr Zuckerberg said that even though he would focus on private and secure conversations, the public forums for communication popularised by Facebook would continue.

       " datetime.date(2019, 3, 8): '[SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said the future of his company\\'s product development will be focused on private, ephemeral and encrypted communication, a striking change for the social network that built its business on open sharing.More people want to interact privately or in more intimate groups online, instead of in \"the digital equivalent of a town square\" provided by Facebook and Instagram, Mr Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a blog post. To serve that demand, the world\\'s largest social-networking company will rebuild many of its features, he wrote, noting that smaller groups and more private, temporary posts are the fastest-growing areas of digital communications.\"I understand that many people don\\'t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform - because frankly we don\\'t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services, and we\\'ve historically focused on tools for more open sharing,\" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. \"But we\\'ve repeatedly shown that we can evolve to build the services that people really want, including in private messaging and stories.\"Mr Zuckerberg framed the strategy as a user choice, including the phrase \"people want\" six times in his blog post, and citing the fast growth of ephemeral and private communication on his company\\'s services. But it may benefit Facebook most by helping address two of the top issues weighing on the company: Users and governments are concerned about keeping personal information private on the social network, and Facebook has struggled to stop the spread of content that is false, violent or concerning in some way.In the post, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook\\'s move to encrypted messaging could be safer for government dissidents and others with controversial views. The shift could also create more online spaces that Facebook wouldn\\'t be able to monitor or police, at a time when encrypted and anonymous posts on Facebook\\'s WhatsApp messaging application are already helping fuel violence and conflict in places such as India.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nMr Zuckerberg didn\\'t explain how the move would affect Facebook\\'s advertising business.

       " datetime.date(2019, 2, 23): 'Every single day, millions of people around the world share messages, videos and images with the people whom they care about, using Facebook. That also means that every single day, Facebook makes important decisions about what content stays up and what comes down, in line with our community standards. That has not always been easy as our experience around the world and in the Asia-Pacific has shown, but our priority remains keeping our global community safe, while making sure that everyone has a voice on issues which matter to them.Facebook is embarking on a year-long process beginning in Singapore this week to design a global body that will have the authority to review our most challenging and contentious content moderation decisions. The aim is that this board will exercise independent judgement when reviewing our most difficult and disputed content decisions and hold us publicly accountable if we do not get them right. We want the board to ensure that Facebook strikes the right balance between giving people a voice and keeping people safe from abusive, harmful or false content. This should - in time - bring more perspective, accountability and transparency to our content decisions. The board\\'s decisions will be binding. It will have the power to overrule or uphold Facebook\\'s content decisions and recommend changes or additions to policies if they are out of line with our values.Supporting this is a recently published draft charter outlining a model for how the board would operate. The charter includes a variety of considerations and questions that need to be answered in order to achieve our goal of convening an independent board: How many members should make up the board and how should they be selected? How should the board select cases to review? How can the board ensure cultural sensitivity and awareness when reviewing cases from all over the world? What level of transparency should the board give into its deliberations?In the workshop that we held this week in Singapore - the first of several to be held around the world - we brought together a group of 40 academics, experts and civil society from across the Asia-Pacific to start to answer those questions. Our aim is to listen to our partners\\' diverse range of perspectives, and incorporate them into the board\\'s design process. These insights will be critical in helping to design a board that can serve our global community and uphold our values, while bringing independent judgment to hard cases. Other workshops will follow this year in Delhi, Nairobi, Berlin, New York, Mexico City, with more to come.The success and the ultimate effectiveness of the board will depend on its ability to accommodate an inclusive and diverse range of perspectives, across language, culture and experience. Singapore - with its commitment to plurality - is an ideal place to start this global conversation. While the board cannot include representatives from every country and culture, the Asia-Pacific will be represented on the board alongside other regions. It will consist of up to 40 global experts with experience in content, privacy, free expression, human rights, journalism and safety.

Most existing computer chips, in order to handle the amount of data these machine learning systems need to learn, divide it into chunks and process each batch in sequence.\"We don\\'t want to leave any stone unturned, particularly if no one else is turning them over,\" he said in an interview ahead of the release on Monday of a research paper he authored on the history and future of computer hardware designed to handle artificial intelligence.Intel Corp and Facebook have previously said they are working together on a new class of chip designed specifically for artificial intelligence applications.

       " datetime.date(2019, 2, 3): 'San FranciscoWHEN Facebook employees woke up on Wednesday morning, many found they could not perform even the most basic work tasks.Their calendars were not working. Nor were campus maps that help people find their co-workers. They were unable to check Facebook\\'s latest shuttle bus schedule. And they could not see what the company\\'s cafeterias were serving for lunch.That\\'s because those features run on Facebook\\'s internal, custom-built iPhone apps - and Apple had shut them all down, according to nine current and former employees of the companies, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.The situation stemmed from a dispute after Facebook violated Apple\\'s rules by publicly distributing a research app that allowed it to snoop on users\\' online activity. When Apple discovered the transgression this week, it revoked Facebook\\'s special access to apps and updates that run on its iPhone software.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nThat immediately cut off Facebook\\'s 35,000 workers from its internal iPhone apps. And the problem snowballed when mobile apps like Workplace and Messenger - two internal communication tools - also stopped working, frustrating employees and resulting in hours of lost productivity.\\nLate on Thursday, Apple relented and restored Facebook\\'s access. Yet the episode was a stark reminder of where the power really lies in the technology world. While Facebook is the world\\'s biggest social network, Apple controls the distribution of apps - including Facebook\\'s - on its phones. That power is a long-standing concern for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\\'s founder and chief executive, making his company beholden to the rules of others.\\nThe spat underscored the tensions between two of Silicon Valley\\'s largest tech companies, which have competed for years over talent and new technologies. Recently, each has taken potshots at the other over data privacy, with Apple\\'s chief executive, Tim Cook, trading slights with Mr Zuckerberg in interviews. Facebook also worked this past year with a public-relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, to urge reporters to scrutinise Apple and other tech companies. And Apple has made changes to some of its tech features that limit the ability of Facebook and others to track users.\\nApple did not immediately have a comment Thursday after reinstating Facebook\\'s access to its internal apps. In a statement, Facebook said it was \"getting our internal apps up and running\" and added, \"To be clear, this didn\\'t have an impact on our consumer-facing services.\"\\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\\'s chief operating officer, said of the dispute with Apple: \"Obviously we want to be in full compliance with all of our partners.\" She added that the Facebook research app at issue hadn\\'t been a secret and had been operated only with its users\\' consent.\\nShow of power\\nApple also briefly demonstrated its power on Thursday with another Silicon Valley giant, Google. Like Facebook, Google had violated Apple\\'s rules by publicly distributing an app, Screenwise Meter, through a special Apple developer program.

REGN NO. 198402668E, IT IS easy to be outraged by the revelation\\xa0that Facebook has been paying users between the ages of 13\\xa0and 35 up to US$20 a month to allow practically unlimited access to their smartphone usage data. But outrage\\xa0about the social media giant is so 2017.\\xa0The latest dubious practice could be an opportunity to consider a more finely tuned business model than the one that Facebook uses today.According to an investigation\\xa0by Josh Constine for TechCrunch, the young users are paid for installing an app called Facebook Research, offered through the beta-testing services Applause, BetaBound and uTest, not directly by Facebook. The app asks users to install a root certificate, which gives Facebook access to pretty much everything that the phone contains, from private message exchanges to location data.This sounds like spying on young people who may not understand what they are allowing, and appears to contradict Apple\\'s app store policies. After the TechCrunch report came out, Facebook said that it would remove the app from the store; it would still be available for Android phones, though.In a statement, Facebook said\\xa0that the users knew what they were doing; they had given their permission and taken the money, and the 5 per cent of the participating users who were teens had all provided signed parental consent forms.\\xa0I am not going to split hairs about whether Facebook made crystal clear to the users (and to the parents who signed these forms)\\xa0what level of access they would be providing. Facebook has a poor record of explaining how much data it collects and how.In the wholesale market for personal data, companies trade or use our information to target advertising. The average value of an active user to Facebook, based on its most recent earnings release, reached about US$2 per month in the third quarter of 2018; in the US and Canada, it was about US$9.20. The more precisely\\xa0data can be targeted to a user, the more that user is worth.\\xa0Clearly, a person\\'s data cannot be worth more to an ad-driven business than the ad revenue that person can bring in.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nSo US$20 a\\xa0month should not seem a paltry sum for running the Facebook Research app, even if the highly granular data that is collected do not just improve targeting precision but also help\\xa0the giant find startups to acquire or outcompete.\\xa0 The problem is that while a wholesale market for personal data exists, a retail one does not.\\nThat is a shame. The actual owners and real-time producers of data -\\xa0we the people -should have a say in how much our information is worth.\\xa0\\nCompanies that make money from online advertising should give us an explicit opportunity to sell them our data. The incentive for companies would be that users who sell their data would sign away their privacy through a simple waiver. Like the participants in the Facebook research programme, they would knowingly let the social media site get everything that it can from their phones.\\xa0\\nI imagine quite a few people would agree because they already police their phone use so as to have few secrets. Many employers\\xa0install tracking apps on company phones. Young people, too, might\\xa0attach relatively little value to their routine communications, Internet and app use data.\\nSuch contracts, of course, would make it necessary for other users to be able to cut off communications on the platform with people who are giving up their data for cash: Message exchanges with them would be exposed. That, however, can be solved with a single checkbox in the settings.\\nWith a broader base of paid users giving up all their data, Facebook could fine-tune its ad-targeting techniques,\\xa0make better inferences about its entire universe of users and perhaps even run behavioural experiments that otherwise would be\\xa0considered unethical. It would have blanket permission for all that in exchange for a fee that would, in the end, be determined by the market.\\nThe\\xa0users who do not want to participate\\xa0could remain in the free layer, based on the same rules that determine Facebook\\'s data collection today. They would still give up some data -\\xa0as much as Facebook can trick them into releasing. And they would see more or less precisely targeted ads based on their settings.\\xa0\\nI am also in favour of introducing a third, subscription-based layer, for which Facebook would guarantee no data collection and no ads. The subscription fees could offset the money paid to people selling their data; theoretically, the point at which this happens would set the market-clearing retail price of our Web privacy.\\xa0\\nIntroducing the three layers would go a long way towards fixing Facebook\\'s regulatory problems: It would be hard to argue with a market-based mechanism for setting privacy levels. At the same time, it would allow the company to retain an advertising-based business model, which chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has said he prefers to a\\xa0subscription-based one. Many users, after all, would prefer to stay in the free layer on today\\'s terms.\\nFacebook has often objected to regulation, arguing that it would stifle innovation.

REGN NO. 198402668E, [SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook said on Wednesday that quarterly profit climbed to an all-time record US$6.9 billion as it boosted its global user base despite scandals that have dented the leading social network\\'s image.Revenue soared 30 per cent from a year ago to US$16.9 billion while the number of people using Facebook monthly rose nine per cent to 2.32 billion, the company said in its fourth quarter update.Net profit for Facebook, which makes most of its money from online advertising, was up a strong 61 per cent from the same period last year.\"Our community and

faced challenges over data protection scandals.\\n\"With these results, Facebook has clearly demonstrated that the challenges of 2018 have not had a lasting impact on its ability to increase both revenues and usage,\" said analyst Debra Aho Williamson of the research firm eMarketer.\\n\"Advertisers are clearly still very reliant on Facebook.\"\\nThe fact that daily active usage in North America and Europe increased was a \"surprise\" after the flatness seen in the US and Canada last year and the falloff that took place in Europe, according to the analyst.\\nFacebook has pledged to hire thousands of employees and invest in new technologies to respond to concerns about manipulation and abuse, and to take data protection more seriously.\\nThe number of employees as of Dec 31 was

Mr Zuckerberg testified for the first time in front of Congress in April, explaining why Facebook allowed users\\' data to fall into the hands of unauthorised third parties. In his reflection on Friday, he made the case that Facebook is now a changed company, and will be more proactive about problems.\"We\\'ve fundamentally altered our DNA to focus more on preventing harm in all our services,\" he wrote.The blows to Facebook\\'s reputation also have hurt the stock, which declined 24 per cent this year through Thursday\\'s close, while the S&P 500 dropped 6.9 per cent.

       " datetime.date(2018, 12, 25): 'New YorkAFTER a year-long string of news reports that have called Facebook\\'s data-sharing practices into question, US federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users.It is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were levelled by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices. That agreement, called a consent decree, provides a roadmap for how the FTC is likely to scrutinise Facebook over the coming months.Why did the FTC accuse Facebook of deceptive privacy practices in the first place?In 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users\\' online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis. Facebook\\'s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, apologised with what an article in The New York Times described as a \"symphony of contrition\". In a Facebook post that year, he wrote: \"I\\'m not proud of the way we\\'ve handled this situation and I know we can do better.\"\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nAt the end of 2009, a coalition of non-profit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the FTC to investigate Facebook\\'s handling of user data. The groups filed a complaint, saying Facebook had repeatedly disregarded users\\' expectations and diminished their privacy. The complaint argued that the company had violated a federal law prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices. In 2011, the FTC filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy.\\nWhat were the FTC\\'s charges against Facebook?\\nThe FTC\\'s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them:\\nFacebook shared users\\' personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said.\\nFacebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all their personal data - even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said.\\nIn 2009, the agency said Facebook changed its information-handling practices, making certain personal details - such as users\\' friends lists - public, overriding the choices of people who wanted to keep that data private. The policy change, the FTC\\'s complaint said, exposed users\\' profile information, including \"potentially controversial political views or other sensitive information\", to third parties.\\nThe agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its \"Verified Apps program\", but the company did not do so.\\nWhat did the FTC require Facebook to do?\\nIn November 2011, Facebook agreed to settle complaints that it had deceived consumers by \"telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public\", the FTC said in a statement at the time.\\nThe agreement, which became final in 2012, prohibited Facebook from misleading consumers about their data privacy and security. The social network committed to getting the explicit consent of users before making changes that overrode their privacy preferences.\\nThe agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users\\' information and to manage the risks of existing and new products. It also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company\\'s users.\\nWhy is the federal consent agreement relevant now?\\nIn March 2018, The New York Times reported that a voter-profiling company, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or permission. The voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook.\\nAlthough only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users\\' friends - consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported.\\nPrivacy experts, law professors and at least one former FTC official have argued that Facebook\\'s failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users\\' friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook\\'s failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users\\' data and the data of users\\' friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said.\\nThey said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users\\' friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said.\\nThey also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions - steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree.\\n\"The consent decree requires Facebook to always be vigilant to possible privacy problems and try to solve them,\" said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former director of consumer protection at the FTC who oversaw the investigation that led to the consent decree. \"Cambridge Analytica made clear that Facebook was not auditing third-party apps.\"\\nOn Mar 26, the FTC said it was conducting an investigation into Facebook\\'s privacy practices. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment on the progress of the investigation.\\nWhat does Facebook say?\\nFacebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree.\\n\"We are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people\\'s privacy settings,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \"We have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people\\'s information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services.\"\\nMs Aldous said the company\\'s privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms - including a privacy governance team and security teams that \"ensure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed and escalated for decisions when necessary\".\\nFacebook said it disagreed with The Times\\' characterisation of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies. The social network said device-makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes.

While some of the deals date back as far as 2010, the Times said they remained active as late as 2017 - and some were still in effect this year.Facebook late on Wednesday pushed back against critics, saying it had carefully negotiated deals with select partners to explore features such as friends sharing what they were listening to on Spotify or watching on Netflix.\"In the past day, we\\'ve been accused of disclosing people\\'s private messages to partners without their knowledge,\" Facebook vice president of product partnerships Ime Archibong said in a blog post. \"That\\'s not true.\" To exchange messages or complete tasks such as sharing files or sending money, apps being used require the relevant technical access. \"Why did the messaging partners have read/write/delete messaging access?\" he asked rhetorically. \"That was the point of this feature.\"The experiences at issue were publicly discussed, and only available when people used Facebook to log into services, according to the social network.\"No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission,\" Mr Archibong said.Facebook\\'s head of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, noted most of the features are now gone.Netflix said that the feature was used to make the streaming service \"more social\" by allowing users to make recommendations to friends, but that it stopped using it in 2015. \"At no time did we access people\\'s private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so,\" Netflix said in a statement.Spotify offered a similar response, indicating the music service \"cannot read users\\' private Facebook inbox messages across any of our current integrations\".Canadian bank RBC, also cited in the New York Times, said the deal with Facebook \"was limited to the development of a service that enabled clients to facilitate payment transactions to their Facebook friends\", and that it was discontinued in 2015.Senator Brian Schatz said the latest revelations highlight a need for tougher controls on how tech companies handle user data. \"It has never been more clear,\" he tweeted. \"We need a federal privacy law.

       " datetime.date(2018, 12, 16): '[SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook announced Friday it had discovered a bug that allowed outsiders access to private photos, potentially affecting some 6.8 million people who use the service.\"We have fixed the issue but, because of this bug, some third-party apps may have had access to a broader set of photos than usual,\" said Tomer Bar, an engineering director at the company.The announcement is the latest in a string of problems the social network has had with consumer data. This most recent incident is somewhat less severe than previous ones. Around 1,500 third-party apps had access to users\\' uploaded photos — even if they had not posted them publicly to Facebook — from Sept 13 to Sept 25.Facebook said the number of people affected was probably smaller than 6.8 million, because it doubted that all 1,500 apps gained access to the social network during that 12-day period.

       " datetime.date(2018, 12, 12): 'CanberraGOOGLE and Facebook Inc face a regulatory crackdown in Australia after the nation\\'s competition watchdog joined a chorus of international criticism over their use of data and the market power they wield across news and advertising.In a preliminary report released on Monday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said a new or existing watchdog should investigate and monitor how large digital platforms rank and display adverts and news. It also expressed concern about a lack of transparency in how their key algorithms work. \"The ACCC considers that the strong market position of digital platforms like Google and Facebook justifies a greater level of regulatory oversight,\" chairman Rod Sims said. The report contains 11 preliminary recommendations and eight areas for further analysis as the inquiry continues.The tech giants have come under increased scrutiny internationally amid concern about the dissemination of fake news and their potential to dominate online advertising. US lawmakers have lambasted Facebook for failing to stop a flood of Russian propaganda during the 2016 election, while European regulators are looking at the advertising practices of digital platforms. \"This is a sign that Australia is looking to follow Europe\\'s lead in putting some sort of restrictions on these two companies\\' enormous sway in the market,\" said Andrew Hughes, a lecturer in marketing at the Australian National University. \"It\\'s hard to think that this will curtail their dominance, but at least it\\'s a start in drawing a line and saying there needs to be more oversight.\"The ACCC said Google and Facebook had become the \"dominant gateways between news media businesses and audiences\", leading to a loss of advertising revenue and ultimately cuts in the number of journalists who could play an important role in \"exposing corruption and holding governments, companies, powerful individuals and institutions to account\". The competition watchdog said its \"preliminary view is that consumers face a potential risk of filter bubbles, or echo chambers, and less reliable news on digital platforms\". A lack of transparency in key algorithms makes it difficult to know if the tech giants are favouring their own business interests over advertisers using the platforms, the ACCC said.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: Google\\'s Sensorvault helps police track where you\\'ve been  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nGoogle said in a response to questions about the report that \"we develop innovative products to the benefit of consumers, businesses and the economy, and we work closely with advertisers and publishers across Australia\".

       " datetime.date(2018, 11, 27): 'THE facebook platform has been used to disrupt elections, disseminate propaganda and promote hate. Regular users should ask if they are implicated in these failings.I joined Facebook in 2008, and for the most part, I have benefited from being on it. Lately, however, I have wondered whether I should delete my Facebook account. As a philosopher with a special interest in ethics, I am using \"should\" in the moral sense. That is, in light of recent events implicating Facebook in objectionable behaviour, is there a duty to leave it?In moral philosophy, it is common to draw a distinction between duties to oneself and duties to others. From a self-regarding perspective, there are numerous reasons one might have a duty to leave Facebook. For one thing, Facebook can be time-consuming and addictive, to no fruitful end. In addition, as researchers have demonstrated, Facebook use can worsen depression and anxiety. Someone who finds himself mindlessly and compulsively scrolling through Facebook, or who is constantly comparing himself unfavourably with his Facebook friends, might therefore have a duty of self-care to get off Facebook.From the perspective of one\\'s duties to others, the possibility of a duty to leave Facebook arises once one recognises that Facebook has played a significant role in undermining democratic values around the world. For example, Facebook has been used to spread white supremacist propaganda and anti-Semitic messages in and outside the United States. The United Nations has blamed Facebook for the dissemination of hate speech against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar that resulted in their ethnic cleansing.Facebook also enabled the political data firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal information of millions of voters in the United States so they could be targeted with personalised political advertisements. A significant amount of fake news can be found on Facebook, and for many users, Facebook has become a large echo chamber, where people merely seek out information that reinforces their views.\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\nSome people might think that because they mostly share photos of their cats on Facebook, such concerns do not apply to them. But this is not so, for three reasons.

       " datetime.date(2018, 11, 18): 'BerkeleyA JOB at Facebook sounds pretty plum. The interns make around US$8,000 a month and an entry-level software engineer makes about US$140,000 a year. The food is free. There\\'s a walking trail with indigenous plants and a juice bar.But the tone among highly sought-after computer scientists about the social network is changing. On a recent night at the University of California, Berkeley, as a group of young engineers gathered to show off their tech skills, many said they would avoid taking jobs at the social network.\"I\\'ve heard a lot of employees who work there don\\'t even use it,\" said Niky Arora, 19, an engineering student, who was recently invited to a Facebook recruiting event at the company\\'s headquarters in Menlo Park. \"I just don\\'t believe in the product because like, Facebook, the baseline of everything they do is desire to show people more ads.\"Emily Zhong, 20, a computer science major, piped up. \"Surprisingly, a lot of my friends now are like: \\'I don\\'t really want to work for Facebook,\\'\" she said, citing \"privacy stuff, fake news, personal data, all of it\".\\n\\n\\n SEE ALSO: EU copyright revamp targeting Google, Facebook set for approval on Monday  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    googletag.cmd.push(function() {\\n      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\");\\n    });\\n  \\n\\n\\n\"Before it was this glorious, magical thing to work there,\" said Jazz Singh, 18, and also studying computer science. \"Now it\\'s like, just because it does what you want doesn\\'t mean it\\'s doing good.\"\\nAs Facebook has been rocked by scandal after scandal, some young engineers are souring on the company. Many are still taking jobs there but those who do are doing it a little more quietly, telling their friends they will work to change it from within or that they have carved out more ethical work at a company whose reputation has turned toxic.\\nFacebook, which employs more than 30,000 full-time workers around the world, said: \"In 2018, we\\'ve hired more engineers than ever before.\" The company added, \"We continue to see strong engagement and excitement within the engineering community at the prospect of joining our company.\"\\nThe changing attitudes are happening beyond Facebook. Across Silicon Valley, tech recruiters said job applicants in general are now asking more hard questions during interviews, wanting to know specifically what they would be asked to do at the company. Career coaches said they have tech employees reaching out to get tips on handling moral quandaries. The questions include: \"How do I avoid a project I disagree with?\" and \"How do I remind my bosses of the company mission statement?\"\\n\"Employees are wising up to the fact that you can have a mission statement on your website, but when you\\'re looking at how the company creates new products or makes decisions, the correlation between the two is not so tightly aligned,\" said David Chie, the head of Palo Alto Staffing, a tech job placement service in Silicon Valley. \"Everyone\\'s having this conversation.\"\\nWhen engineers apply for jobs, they are also doing it differently.\\n\"They do a lot more due diligence,\" said Heather Johnston, Bay Area district president for the tech job staffing agency Robert Half. \"Before, candidates were like: \\'Oh, I don\\'t want to do team interviews, I want a one-and-done.\\'\" Now, she said, job candidates \"want to meet the team. They\\'re not just going to blindly take a company because of the name anymore.\"\\nYet while many of the big tech companies have been hit by a change in public perception, Facebook seems uniquely tarred among young workers. \"I\\'ve had a couple of clients recently say they\\'re not as enthusiastic about Facebook because they\\'re frustrated with what they see happening politically or socially,\" said Paul Freiberger, president of Shimmering Careers, a career counselling group based in San Mateo. \"It\\'s privacy and political news, and concern that it\\'s going to be hard to correct these things from inside.\"\\nOn the recent evening at the University of California, Berkeley, around 2,200 engineering students from around the country gathered for Cal Hacks 5.0 - a competition to build the best apps. The event spanned a weekend, so teenage competitors dragged pillows around with them. The hosts handed out 2,000 burritos as students registered.\\nIt was also a hiring event. Recruiters from Facebook and Alphabet set up booths (free sunglasses from Facebook; US$200 in credit to the Google Cloud platform from Alphabet).\\nIn the auditorium, the head of the startup incubator and investment firm, Y Combinator, gave opening remarks, recommending that young people avoid jobs in big tech.\\n\"You get to programme your life on a totally different scale,\" said Michael Seibel, who leads Y Combinator. \"The worst thing that can happen to you is you get a job at Google.\" He called those jobs \"US$100,000 a year welfare\" - meaning, he said, that workers can get tethered to the pay cheque and avoid taking risks.\\nThe event then segued to a word from the sponsor, Microsoft. Justin Garrett, a Microsoft recruiter who on his LinkedIn profile calls himself a senior technical evangelist, stepped on stage, laughing a little. \"So, Michael\\'s a tough guy to follow, especially when you work for one of those big companies,\" Mr Garrett said. \"He called it welfare.
